  CHAPTER I.  
  
  
  WHY WALTER WAS AT BERWERTON.—AUNT JANE AND
HER VISITORS.


\"It is a truth and not an idle phrase, that man does not live
by bread alone; that it is his privilege to live by aspiration,
hope, and love, to be moved by ideal impulses which cause him
to check the impulses of a lower self, to forego the transient
pleasures of sense, and passionately strive after nobler pleasures
of heart and intellect. We all place before ourselves the ideal
of a noble life, the type of a grander character than our
infirmities enable us to realise, and we do not look on that ideal as a
fiction, on that type of character as a falsehood, because we fail
to realise it.

\"Like the typical laws of physical processes, these
conceptions are solid truths, though they exist only as ideals; and he
who imagines their validity impugned because human nature
can but imperfectly realise them, is as ignorant of life as he
would be who should deny the validity of natural laws because
of the purturbations observable in natural events."—G. H.
Lewes : Problems of Life and Mind.

\"Good-bye, Walter, if you will really give this pattern
for me to Aunt Jane, and so save my having to go
to her, I shall be glad, otherwise I shall hardly catch
the children before they go out of school; it is later than
I thought it was. Give the good woman my love. If
1
<!-- Leaf 10, Page: 2 -->
she does not understand the pattern, I will come soon
and show her about it. Do not forget that you are to
ride with me the day after to-morrow, to say what you
think about Johnson's colt."


\"Good-bye, my Katie," replied the person addressed,
\"I will do all you wish; expect me at two o'clock the

after to-morrow, prepared to pick you out of the
<litch into which John son's colt will probably deposit you."


The speakers were standing by a gateway, through
which a drive led out of a shady lane. The brilliant
sunshine of July fell in flecks and patches on the road,
wherever it could pierce through the interstices of the
leaves or between the stems of the grand old beech trees
guarding each side of the lane. Generation after
generation of cattle had habitually regaled themselves on the
twigs and leaves of the beeches to such heights as they
could reach, so keeping the leaves and lower branches
to a uniform level.


Looking under the trees on one side of the lane, a
pleasant landscape met the eye—grass fields sloped
gently into a little valley, through which a brook ran;
the hay-harvest was not yet gathered, and the smell of
new hay and the sound of workmen's voices came up
from the valley.


On the far side of the brook was a high, steep bank,
mostly covered with close-growing gorse, miniature
precipices of red sandstone jutting out here and there;
beyond this bank the land rose and sloped gently
upwards, so that the eye might range far over green corn
fields, meadows, and woodlands, till vision met its limit in
a range of low blue hills in the far distance. On the
other side the lane was the gateway before mentioned,
<!-- Leaf 11, Page: 3 -->
and one field's length away from it a small house might
he seen, half hidden among trees.


The man called "Walter stood for some few moments
looking at the girl he had been talking with, as she
walked quickly away from him. She made a pleasant
object for the eye to follow—a gleam of sunshine from
time to time touching her dress or lighting up her
golden hair; her step, bearing, figure, attire, all
suggestive of youth, beauty, and summer-time. Sometimes
we feel curious to see the face of some stranger walking
before us, from an impression that one worthy of
admiration is hid from our view; chance affords the
gratificacation of our wish and—we are disappointed. In the
case of Catherine Gresford, no such disappointment
•could happen to the most fastidious. The suggestion
of youth and beauty received from her figure was fully
■carried out in her face—such a pretty, merry, sunny
face, such sweet red lips, often parting in smiles or
laughter, and displaying little pearl-white teeth. As I
said before, Walter gazed after her for some moments, for
some moments more gazed over the country with half
dreamy eyes, then leisurely opened the gate, and
walked up a short drive to the house among the trees.

As Walter Forbes is our hero, it may be well to give

a short account of his position and parentage, first
saying that he was a tall, slightly built man, his
countenance pale and thoughtful in expression, of no beauty
of form, in no way remarkable, except for quick changing
indications of feeling, and dark grey observant eyes.
He is the accepted lover of pretty Katie; he had now,
at the time our story begins, already held this position
for two years, having first achieved it when on a long
1—2
<!-- Leaf 12, Page: 4 -->
visit to a relative, then residing at the house of which
he (Forbes) was now the possessor. His father,
Algernon Forbes, had been a clever, extravagant, thriftless
young officer—younger brother to a rich squire owning
much land in Cumberland. While with his regiment
at Chester, Algernon had fallen in love with Miss
Nancy Glyndon, the belle of the county—of a good
old impoverished family, and youngest of sixteen
brothers and sisters. A marriage was arranged and took
place without the knowledge of the relations upon either
side. Algernon was not without the means of giving
his wife as many or more of the comforts and luxuries
of life as had been hers to enjoy in her father's home,
and for a while he did so, giving up a horse or two, and
abstaining from other costly indulgences. His
selfdenial was not lasting. Before his boy was born, he
had ceased to refuse himself the gratification of any
extravagant whim that might possess him. Creditors
began to press for payment of their claims. Before the
second year of her married life had quite passed, Nancy
had suffered much from neglect, and had dire
forebodings that she and her boy might have to suffer from
actual want, unless she could bend her pride to ask for
help from offended relations. When the year closed
her husband was dead. He sickened with scarlet fever
while on an expedition to an out-of-the-way village
to watch the training of race-horses. Letters were
written to his wife and brother telling them of his
illness; they came to him in time to close his eyes and
follow him to his last resting-place.


Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Algernon Forbes and her
boy were transplanted to Scarcalder, Squire Forbes'
<!-- Leaf 13, Page: 5 -->
residence in Cumberland; they were welcomed there in
the kindest possible way. From thence, after the lapse
of some years, Mrs. A. Forbes was married to a rich
barrister, whose home was in London.


Walter remained with his uncle, who brought him up
as a son, always, however, making him understand that
when his education was completed he must follow a
profession, and make a way in life for himself. At the
time Walter first came to Scarcalder, Mr. and Mrs.
Forbes had no child; two years afterwards a little girl
was horn. Failing a son, the squire's estates were
entailed on his brother, a colonial sheep-farmer possessing
numerous sons and daughters. Young Walter so passed
through Harrow and Oxford that great things were
prophesied for his future. His uncle was willing, and
Mrs. Forbes and Mrs. Seymour were most desirous, that
their darling should enter the priesthood of the
Anglican Church, in which position they thought he would
prove to be a shining and a burning light. A family
living falling vacant, it was given to a clergyman to
hold upon the understanding that he must give place to
young Forbes if that young man should feel inclined
to prepare himself to undertake the office of pastor and
guardian of souls to the Cumberland shepherds. The
young man did not feel so inclined, and good orthodox
Mr. Skidtkwaite was left undisturbed to the exercise of
offices which he apparently was more fitted to perform
adequately than would have been the young Oxford

prizeman.


What occupation, then, would Mr. Walter Forbes
desire to pursue ? He was long in deciding, and
although disinclined towards all the suggestions made,
<!-- Leaf 14, Page: 6 -->
had apparently no project of his own to put
forward.


At last, more in submission to his uncle's wishes than
in accordance with his own, he agreed to read for
theprofession of law.


While at Oxford, Walter had chanced to meet an old
cousin of his mother's, a clergyman, who, partly from
the infirmities of age, and partly from some change in
Iris views as to Church matters, had given up preferment,
retired to an old house he owned, and devoted himself
to literary pursuits.


This man took the greatest fancy to Walter, who, in
the interval of leaving Oxford and deciding upon a
profession, stayed some timejit his house, and while there
met Catherine Gresford, knelt at her feet and was not
spurned, her father reluctantly agreeing to his daughter's
becoming formally engaged to Walter, under an
impression that " old Forbes would surely do something "
for his favourite nephew.


Old Forbes manifested no intention of doing anything
more than animadverting upon his nephew's "utter folly
and nonsense, just like his poor father's; and whatever
the girl might be, her father must be a fool not to put
an end to such rubbish."


Squire Forbes' vexation and anger were considerably
augmented when Walter, after having nearly finished
a course of law-reading under the guidance of an
eminent member of the legal profession, wrote to
Cumberland, informing his relatives there that the study of
law was wholly distasteful to him; not only that—he
found that conscientious motives would deter him from
practising the profession; he besought that he might
<!-- Leaf 15, Page: 7 -->
not be considered ungrateful for the incalculable benefits
he had received—of course, he was aware he had forfeited
all possibility of their continuance; he intended to live
in London and devote himself to literature; he hoped
his uncle would sanction the plan. A very angry man
was the warm- hearted, hot-tempered northern squire on
receiving that letter; his reply was curt; he said :


\"Go to the dogs in any way you please; I will have
no more to do with you."


Walter Forbes did not go to the dogs—he went to his
mother, who lived in a comfortable house in Hyde Park
Street. She reproached him, she lectured him; but she
was too glad to have her son for her very own again—to
pet, indulge and give money to him—to feel seriously
angry at his enormities.


At that time Mrs. Seymour was again a widow, still
very pretty and engaging, accustomed to enter into
much society, and that good society. She often gave
little parties to which clever and nice people came
willingly, and held pleasant converse with each other.


Walter loved his mother dearly; but before this time,
had frequented her home but little; he had lived with
his preceptors, really reading hard, and seldom going
into other society than such law society as his mentor
introduced him to. His mother's world was new to him,
and he found it to be a very attractive world; he greatly
enjoyed listening to and conversing with the men and
women who composed it; among them were a sprinkling
of savants and literati.


The days passed pleasantly, and became so fully
occupied that fits of gloom and sorrow consequent upon
changed relations with his northern kin ceased to recur
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: 8 -->
frequently. He spent much of the day in reading and
making beginnings of writings; he also, with close
observation, studied things, men and manners—pictures,
the drama, old china; lastly, a little to his mother's
distress, he began to have advanced notions about
cooking, and the desirability of conducting it upon art
principles.


Almost six months of this life had flowed by. The
month of June came, and plans for an autumn at
Geneva were under discussion, when one morning a
letter arrived from a lawyer stating that Mr. Hoare
was dead, and had left his old house, its contents, some
few acres of land, and four thousand pounds to Walter.
Walter mourned for his old friend, whose gentle
kindness to him had Avon his heart, while he had readily
acknowledged him an intellectual superior.


Mrs. Seymour's open congratulations and joy jarred
upon her son. It was long before the pride of possession
came to him; he knew he had lost what nothing could
replace—he had lost a friend, and the shock of the loss
had come upon him suddenly, and there was sadness in the
thought that he had been amusing himself and
delighting in life while his dear friend was passing through
the valley of the shadow of death.


Before long it was needful that Walter should go and
see his property; he went. On his return he tried to
persuade his mother to let her house in London and
come and live with him at Berwerton Manor. Mrs.
Seymour let herself be persuaded without much
difficulty, as, though she felt no great inclinations to bury
herself alive in a country village, the plan offered
economical advantages, and she had lately be<mn to
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 9 -->
wish to save a little fortune for the clever loving son,
about whose ability to amass a fortune or sufficient
income from the fruits of his own labour many misgivings
had arisen in her mind.


So Walter's wishes carried the day, and the plan of
emigration was clenched by an eligible tenant taking
the London house.


Mrs. Seymour, her son, her old Swiss man-servant,
brougham, horse, and maid, found themselves among
green fields and roses the last week in June. From then
to the opening of our tale more than a year had passed,
and no return to London was yet in contemplation.


We will end this digression, and continue our
narrative. Walter opened the gate and walked slowly along
the short drive; on each side of it were evergreen
shrubs; a sudden turn to the right brought him directly
in front of a middle-sized red brick house; his
summons on the door-bell was answered by a round short
fat man, who opined that his mistress and Miss Ada
were not in the house, but he didn't think they were far
off. " Shall I look for them in the garden, sir ?"


\"No, thank you, Thompson," said Walter; " I will go
back through the garden, and shall then see Miss
Lewisham, if she is there."


A foot-path through the shrubbery brought him to
the south side of the house, into a small, well laid out
and exceedingly pretty flower garden; there were two
figures in it, a girl budding rose stocks, and a tall, thin
lady, past middle age, walking along in an opposite
direction from the wicket by which our hero entered.
Turning at the end of the path, she came back in a very
vigorous manner; she held a large sunshade directly in
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 10 -->
front of her eyes, and not perceiving Walter, came nearly
into collision with him. He avoided her and spoke.


\"How do you do, Mr. Forbes ? I am afraid I nearly
knocked you down. You do not interrupt my exercise,
I have now done my time—there is a seat in the shade;
come and sit down." At this moment the girl who had
been budding roses came up and greeted the visitor.


\"You have begun to bud roses early. Do you find
the wood sufficiently hardened ?" Walter asked of her.


\"All wood is not," answered Ada Lewisham; " I have
got some Gloires and Alfred Colombs that will do; if I
begin to bud early, and the buds do not take, I can do
some over again."  
  
  
  " True, if you have a good supply of stocks."


\"I have several, and I mean to bud on the stocks in
the hedge of our field, and move them in the autumn."  
  
  
  " An excellent plan, I never thought of it."


\"Now I must go and put two little Alfreds into their
new bed. I see the sun has come on them, and they
will fade."


She went to continue her previous occupation. Miss
Lewisham the elder and Walter seated themselves.
Walter executed the commission Kate had charged him
with.


\"Kate told me to say she would come and explain if
the knitted pattern was not clear enough," he said.


\"Give dear Catherine my best love, and if it should
please Providence that I should ever be able to do that
kind of Avork again, I may very likely be glad of her
instructions."


Walter felt relieved at having to make no reply, for,
as Miss Lewisham spoke, Thompson came up and stated
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 11 -->
that Mr. Morgan Avas in the draAving-room. " Ask him
to come here," said the lady, and the servant departed
to do her bidding.


\"Now, Avhat can he want ?" she said, giving little
nerArous pokes to one hand with the other. " He comes
to beg something, I have no doubt."


Very shortly a man was seen crossing the garden
Avith a solemn, stately, ponderous tread, his head thrown
rather back, his chest and waist rather thrown out.
Upon seeing Walter, his countenance became a little
clouded, a little sulky.


\"How do you do, Miss LeAvisham, ma'm ?—a fine day
to-day, umph—How do you do, sir ? I hope you left
your mother, Mrs. Seymour, in good health ?—umph."


\"I left my mother, Mrs. Seymour, soon after luncheon;
she was then apparently in the possession of good
health, thank you; I think, Miss Lewisham, I Avill
go and see if I can help your niece, and I want to see
if the roses I pruned have done well."


Mr. Morgan, after a moment's consideration as to the
strength of the bench, cautiously loAvered himself into
the place Walter had vacated.


Since Walter Forbes had lived in the country, one of
his greatest hobbies had been gardening.


Ada Lewisham was also a gardener, and the
twofloriculturists Avere always pleased to compare notes.
together.


As Walter approached her, Ada arose from kneeling
before a rose stock. She was one of those people of
whom it is very difficult to give any just impression in
a description. I have called her a girl, because
unmarried women are called girls until middle age has
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 12 -->
long overtaken their girlhood; but she Avas a calm,
selfpossessed Avonran, aged twenty-five. She Avas a little
taller than the average height of Avomen, strongly built,
Avith rather large hands and feet; a noble head,
beautifully poised on her shoulders; her features Avere fine
and classical, except that her forehead was perhaps a
shade too high; her complexion was rather brown, and
not quite a clear brown.


\"I have done," she said, as she stood up. " For what
reason has Mr. Morgan come ?"  
  
  
  Walter glanced at her, and replied :


\"When I left him he had not set forth his reasons;
but your aunt thought he had designs on her purse.—
Hoav did the roses I pruned answer ? May we go aud
look at them ?"


\"They are flowering Avell, but not better than those
Dodson pruned on less scientific principles. I Avant to
show you our Marshal Neil; he is such a beauty !"


When Marshal Neil and other plants had been
discussed, Walter asked :


\"Do you, like me, believe in the great, good influence
of floAvers over us mortals ? I am sure they may be
made to take an important part in civilising uneducated
man, both because of their own direct influence in
calming and elevating his mind, and also because, in talking
about floAvers, the educated and uneducated men can
meet upon something like the same level: Hodge can
have as good roses as you or I can—we can sincerely
express our admiration for them, and discuss their merits
with him."


„Yes, I quite agree with you; but I did not think Hodge
was a creature you had much to do with, Mr. Forbes."
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 13 -->

\"I did A\dien I lived in Cumberland. There Hodge
is a much finer, more intelligent animal than are your
Hodges. But you quite agree with me about the good
flowers do ?"


"Yes, practical people have not been unmindful of it;
they see the use of encouraging Hodge in liking flowers.
Witness the numerous cottage-garden societies and
flower shows in connection with them, that are held in
so many villages and toAvns. I Avish we could regenerate
human nature by starting one here."


\"I dare say flower shows are often productive of good
results; hut it seems to me very difficult to adjudge
prizes to flowers upon competitive examination
principles. I went to the flower show at Drayton the other
day, and saw a really splendid specimen of a Marshal
Neil stripped of its green leaves and stuck in a
blacking-bottle. It received the first prize; other roses,
nearly similarly treated, received the second and third
prizes; while a perfectly beautiful spray of white cluster
roses, mingled with their pink-tipped buds and glossy
leaves, exhibited in a plain glass tumbler, gained no
notice—Avere not even commended. Next year its
exhibitor Avill doubtless strip a rose of its leaves and place
it in a blacking-bottle; so much for the refining
influence of flower shows, not treated as art exhibitions, but
lowered to the level of agricultural shows, and prizes
adjudged in the same way as they are adjudged to
cabbages, carrots, and fat cattle."


\"The cultivation of the Marshal Neil probably cost
more thought and labour to the exhibitor than did the
spray of cluster roses. And flower shows do do good:
Mr. Selwynson says police cases have been below the
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 14 -->
average at Drayton since the cottage-garden society
was started; and he and the vicar have taken a great
deal of trouble to make it work well, though mistakes
may sometimes be made.—I see Thompson bringing tea;
let us go to it."  
  
  
  As she spoke, a slight flush crossed Ada's face.  
  
  
  A little apologetically Walter answered :


\"I would not have uttered a word against Drayton
flower show had I known Mr. Selwynson was its
promoter and manager. In his hands, I am sure, it will in
the end be productive of good, although, as you say, some
mistakes may have been made at first; but I do not feel
convinced that the credit of having diminished the police
•cases is due to the establishment of the garden society.
I should rather attribute it to the direct personal
influence of a good, practical, energetic landlord, resident on
his land, and ever seeking to promote the well-being
of those around him. I was aware that Avhen you
quoted practical people in that marked manner a short
time ago, you intended to censure unpractical people,
or those you thought so; but, you see, I can appreciate
practical people, if I am not of them."


Ada's face again lighted up, and the flush made her
for a moment very beautiful; she merely inclined her
head in answer. They came up to the tea-table, which
was placed in front of the shaded bench. Mr. Morgan
was still seated by Miss LeAvisham, and was still
looking a little sulky; if he had come with a petition, it had
perhaps not been granted.  
  
  
  He rose to greet Ada.


\"Mr. Morgan," said Walter, " we have been talking
about flower shows and cottage-garden societies; Avill
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 15 -->
you help Miss Ada Lewisham to get one up ? Avill you,
Miss Lewisham, patronise it, and also help us by
lending your ground ?"


\"Help you ! I could not do much to help—these neAV
notions puzzle me; but I knoAv my dear brother used to
think a good deal about a flower show he had
something to do with. I went to it once, do you remember,
Ada ?—you were there, and my dear sister, and your
Aunt Elizabeth; it was a pleasant meeting of friends.
I do not remember the flowers, but I suppose, of course,
there were some. There was a tent, and my brother
made a speech."


"Do you really want to have a flower show, Miss
Ada ?" said Mr. Morgan.


\"Yes, I should like a cottage-garden society and a
flower show to be established here very much."


\"Miss Ada Lewisham is prepared to assert, and to
prove her assertions by a statement of statistics, that by
inducing the populace to cultivate flowers, the office of
policeman has become a sinecure, people cease to imbibe
deleterious amounts of alcoholic refreshment, and, in
fact, the millennium begins. Do you cultivate flowers,
Mr. Morgan ? Why not begin ?" said Walter.


"I have something better to do, sir—umph—I don't
understand what you mean—umph. Of course you
do not think so, but / don't call it a pursuit for a man;
flowers are pretty things—I knoAv you are fond of them,
Miss Ada—and I highly approve of ladies liking them
—umph."


\"Thank you, Mr. Morgan; now I have your approval
I shall dig and delve with renewed vigour," answered
Ada.
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 16 -->

Walter Forbes took leave. Mr. Morgan soon folloAved
his example. Then Ada and her aunt went into the
house; at the door Thompson met them, and asked for
the key of the cellar to get out a bottle of sherry. " I
think there will be plenty, Thompson," said his mistress.
\"You know you put some out for luncheon."


Thompson looked a little uncomfortable, as he replied,
"Yes, ma'am, but Mr.Morgan, ma'am, he asked for a glass
of Avine, and Avhen I come back from telling you he
called, there was no Avine left."


\"Ah well, gentlemen do drink more wine than ladies;
you can get the key; you know where it is."


Never was an unkind word or uncharitable observation
heard to escape from the lips of Miss Lewisham; people
Avho did not know her well seldom gave her credit for
the quiet observation and just appreciation of character
she really possessed, while great was her discretion as
to Avhat use she made of the knowledge she acquired.
The dear old lady had many little peculiarities—one
Avas that of saving her eyes, although there Avas little
the matter with them, and their vision, Avith regard to
all passing around her, Avas very clear and undeceptive.
For the last tAventy years she had been employed in
taking care of her eye-sight; once, prior to the twenty
years ago, her eyes had been Aveak, and it was needful
that she should sit in the dark and take much care.
The habit of taking care remained with her, and in
times of nervous depression, Miss Lewisham felt sure
that Providence Avould never permit her to read or
even to knit again. Occasionally she was carried out of
herself, and talked on in a full blaze of light Avithout
blinking, or read through a volume of a novel Avithout
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 17 -->
pausing. She had a quiet, pale, faded face, and
beautiful white hair, tucked under a nice large old woman's
cap, tied on with ribbon strings in a bow beneath her
chin.


Some said that she was cold, some that she Avas
stingy, while others alleged that she was proud. All
these accusations were false; her affections were true
and deep, and though her face seldom betrayed emotions,
those Avho knew her could tell by the ring of her voice
and the movement of her hand if she Avas suppressing
feeling; her tone when she spoke to one of those she
loved was unmistakable. Her stinginess showed itself
entirely with regard to her own personal comforts and
luxuries; certainly, considering her means, she did not
allow herself an excess of these, but she readily granted
others luxuries with which she Avould have on no
account indulged herself.


Ada had no reason to complain of not having all the
comforts her aunt could provide for her.


\"In these days young people require so much," said
Miss Lewisham, as she ordered her cook to send in a
hot luncheon every day, bought the easiest of
armchairs and couches for Ada's little boudoir, and an extra
arm-chair for the drawing-room, which had previously
possessed but one.


Prior to Ada's advent, Miss Lewisham had had for
her middle of the day repast a scrap of yesterday's
mutton, a leg of a cold rabbit, or any unconsidered
trifle her servants would not eat, and that was too small
to give away. Many and many were the kind generous
deeds she had done, known only to herself and the
recipient of the kindnesses; perhaps she was not what is
2
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 18 -->
called open-handed; she did not court popularity by
giving openly, nor did she give to all that asked of her,
but warily and discriminately. Aunt Jane was the
title by which Miss Lewisham Avas best known, and
oftenest called by relatives and intimate friends alike,
and as Aunt Jane the reader will oftenest hear of her

in future.

  MOTHER AND SON.  
  
  
  " I'll draw you as you stand,
With few or none to watch or wonder;
I'll say—a fisher, on the sand
By Tyre the Old, with ocean-plunder,
A netful brought to land.  
  
  
  Who has not heard how Tyrian shells
Enclosed the blue, that dye of dyes,
Whereof one drop worked miracle,
And coloured like Astarte's eyes
Raw silk the merchant sells !"

Walter Forbes was intending to Avrite a novel; he had
made out a plot. He hoped the world would read his
book; he hoped, hardly acknowledging to himself that
he did so hope, that while gazing upon the abstractions
of nobility and purity he upheld to sight, the sore
sickness of a feAv fellow mortals might be healed. Many
have indulged in like dreams. He rather meditated
introducing an idealised Ada as a heroine; his story Avas
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 19 -->
to have a tragic ending, and Ada, with her calm classic
face and melancholy smile, would suit him very
well as a chief actress, to come to grief in the third
volume. With a view of studying her, he had
frequented her society much of late, and was now walking
home feeling rather discontented.


"I do not grasp her character," he soliloquised. "I
am convinced there is no method so good as to look at
nature and idealise on canvas, but you cannot draw an
ideal if you do not see the real, ' for the ideal is the
spirit of the real.' And then, instead of learning her
opinions and thoughts, I seem to tell her a good lot of
mine, and get little in return—she seems to know
every one's wants by instinct or intuition. She is
evidently engaged, or on the edge of being engaged, to
young Selwynson; besides, Katie knows me too well to
care how much I talk to another. Ah ! here comes the
squire, driving my mother to meet me."  
  
  
  A loud clear voice shouted :


\"Forbes, I didn't want to meet you just as I was
running away with your mother. I suppose it is stand
and deliver now, is it ?"
The speaker was a small, thin old man, with grey
whiskers, a tall white felt hat on. He was driving a
white cob in a Ioav carriage, Avith two walking sticks
beside him.


\"You must give her up, sir. I can't spare her," and
Walter helped his mother out of the carriage.


\"Ah, Avell! some'of these days a man must' leave his
father and mother and cleave unto his wife.' I have
been given to understand that is what you purpose.
Now you didn't think I could talk Scripture like that ?  
  
  
  2—2
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 20 -->

A shade of annoyance crossed Walter's face; the
groom at the cob's head grinned.


\"No, squire, I did not know you could quote
Scripture hke a very learned clerk."


\"Good-day to you, Mrs. Seymour. Ta-ta, Forbes.
Just keep out of the way another time when you're not
Avanted, Avill you ?" and the squire poked up his hat
Avith one finger in salute, and the cob trotted on.


\"Walter, Mr. Gresford has been asking me what your
plans for the future are ?" began Mrs. Seymour.  
  
  
  " What does he mean ?"


\"He means, he Avants to see you in some profession;
he thinks you are Avasting your time, and no nearer to
possessing a sufficient income to marry on. He wants
the quarrel with your uncle made up."


\"I have not quarrelled with my uncle—he quarrelled
with me. I shall be exceeding glad to take his hand
whenever he holds it out to me, but I will not ask him
to hold it out."


\"He would hold it out directly if you Avould agree to
follow his wishes. Let me write' to him and say you
will be a barrister after all. It is all very easy; your
uncle will pay. You have only to eat your dinners;
you have read, you need not go the circuit, and can
write books just the same. I think you ought to please
the old man. Besides, it seems so odd, not being on
terms Avith him. If your poor aunt had lived, the
quarrel would have been made up long ago."


\"It would be most unfair to my uncle to act as you
propose. We have gone over this subject before, mother;
let it rest. Uncle James is in too much sorroAV at
present to care what I do."
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 21 -->

\"But I do so want you to be something. People
talk. I have been asked once or twice what you
are going to do, and when you are to be married. I
know you study, but there seems to be no end to
study."


"People are A^ery kind to take so much interest in
me. You know already that I mean to devote myself
to literary work, and can answer them so."


\"But that means nothing; everybody knows it means
nothing. Lady Dashforth says that a barrister can do
lots of things. There are so many good things a barrister
can hold, and have nothing at all to do."  
  
  
  " But the good things will not fall in my way."


\"Ah, if poor James were alive, he could get something
directly. He knew all the great lawyers. We often
dined at judges' houses three times a week. I think I
could put in a word for you to some of them. Lady
Dashforth would try to do anything I asked her with
her husband the judge."


\"Dear mother, do not think of it. My mind is made
up; I am not going to be a barrister."


\"But, Walter, Mr. Gresford is getting cross. He
says authors live in garrets, and—and it's not
respectable. He would give you a farm, or make you his agent,
but he does not think you are suited for either."  
  
  
  " No, I am afraid I am not."


\"If you were saving, or could look forward to better
things in the suture, I should not think so much about
it; but you knoAv my money goes at my death, and
that might happen any day. You have only about £200
a year and a house of your own, and Kate will have
£100. Now you could not live on £300, unless you
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 22 -->
and Kate change your habits very much. During my
lifetime I might give you £200 more, but "


■''JSTo, we could not live on three hundred; and when I
marry I Avill have nothing from you, my own little mother.
Do not let our affairs be an anxiety to you. Believe
me, I am not wasting time, or merely idling; I am
trying to fit myself for the path I mean- to follow. If
I became a barrister, as you wish, I should have to
train for three years, and it might be many years more
before I obtained an income from my profession. I
have been training for the pursuit I mean to make my
life's occupation only a year and a half, and because I
have shoAvn no fruits for my labour, you have ceased to
believe I ever shall. I am all the more likely to
succeed in the future because (thanks to dear old Hoare
and you) I am so placed that I can take time and
thought for preparation, instead of having to write
hurriedly for my daily bread. It is the duty of the
artist to search for beauty and truth, and show it to
others; but he must first learn to see himself, then to
paint what he sees, before he can enlighten others."


Mrs. Seymour would hardly have let her son arrive
at the end of his speech Avithout interruption had not
her attention been absorbed by endeavouring to
distinguish whose carriage and pair of bays Avere advancing
from the distance.


Walter and his mother entered their domains while
he spoke, passing through the pretty grounds that had
been given by one enthusiastic votary of nature and art
into the hands of another reverent Avorshipper at the
same shrine. They entered the house by a glass door,
leading into the garden from Walter's library.
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 23 -->
Havinoentered the room, he laid a hand on his mother's shoulder,
and stooping down, kissed her, saying, in a voice that
betrayed some emotion:


\"Leave this fig-tree alone for a bit, mother; we will
see what cultivation will do for it. You must leave it
free; a fig-tree Avon's bear fruit if nailed up tight to the
Avail, and pruned into a shape it does not like. I shall
not go to live in the garret just yet."


Mrs. Seymour did not understand her son, but she
loved him; and there is a reciprocation of feeling
between those who love. ' She perceived that he
was moved; with moist eyes she ansAvered, " God bless
you, my boy!" looking into her tall son's face with a
smile in which pride and love were mingled. Let him
do what he would, there were not many like him. Why
should she be in a hurry for him to marry, if he was
content to Avait ? The time that had passed since he lived
with her had been sweet to her, sweeter perhaps than any
time, except the first few months of her earliest
marriage. Walter had been a son and a daughter in one.


\"I Avill tell you a secret, mother. I have sent some
short papers to magazines, and one or two were well
received and printed."


\"Why did you not tell me; I could have said a word
to Lady Dashforth and several others, and they would
get people to buy the magazines, and you would have a
name at once, and to an author a name is everything. Tell
me now, and I Avill write to Lady Dashforth to-morrow."


\"Not so, little woman; I must rise or fall by my own
merits, by the measure of approbation ' vox popidi'
untampered with, will accord to me, not because, as
an act of friendship to you, Lady Dashforth will consent
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 24 -->
to puff me. No one but my publishers will know my
name as a writer for many years."


"We shall keep dinner waiting; let us go and
dress."


The room in which the last part of this conversation
was held certainly bore no resemblance to the bare
apartment which saw the closing scene of Chatterton's
brief existence, as shown forth in the picture we all
knoAv so well. A dim vision of that picture had
perhaps crossed the eyes of Mr. Gresford Avhen he
associated authors and garrets.


Mr. Walter Forbes' study was a high, large room, the
Avails in great part covered with rows upon rows of
books. Some were prize-books, some those he had had
at college, but mostly were the shelves filled by the
choice library bequeathed to him by his predecessor.
The room had three lights on one side: the glass door
we have already spoken of, and two Avindows. In front
of one window stood the student's Avriting table; in
front of the other a stand of beautiful flowers. The
fire-place was a large one, surrounded by blue and
white tiles, and curiously carved wood. On the high
shelf above Avere a few rrre and beautiful specimens
of foreign porcelain and a group of old Chelsea. On
each side of the fire-place Avere carved bureaus; in
front of one of them an arm-chair luxuriously fitted
with a movable reading-desk, and appliances for
lighting. A centre-table was covered with books, many
modern library books and magazines; truly, it had fallen
to the lot of Walter Forbes to conduct his studies in
pleasant places.  
  
  
  " Mother," said Walter, as he led his mother into the
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 25 -->
dining-room, "are you going anywhere Avith Proputty
on Thursday ?"  
  
  
  " No, I think not. Why ?"  
  
  
  " Because I want you to lend him to me."


\"Are you going to take both ponies, or is anything
the matter with Dabchick ? I thought you liked her
best. I have no engagements on Thursday that I can
remember. Where are you going ?"


\"I am going to ride with Kate and Harry, and if
you really do not want Proputty, I thought I would
offer Ada Lewisham a mount. I know she is very fond
of riding, and four is a pleasanter party than three."


Mrs. Seymour paused for a moment before she
answered.


\"I shall be happy to lend Ada Lewisham, Proputty,
but—of course you can have Proputty."


Here the presence of the old Swiss servant brought
the conversation to a close.


An invaluable man Avas that old Swiss; he had been
a "valet de place" and travelled with Mr. and Mrs.
Seymour on their wedding tour. Mr. Seymour liked
him so much, he persuaded him to take permanent
service with him; the man soon became greatly attached
to his master and mistress, and now he gave to Walter
no small share of his affections, indulging and fostering
the young man's fastidious tastes as a clever servant
can do.


Both Mrs. Seymour and Walter had feared that
Francois Avould find village life too dull for him, as the
coachman had found it; but no, the old man gained new
vigour and energy in the pure fresh air. He worked
wonders : helped in the garden, took care of the bees, did odds.
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 26 -->
and ends of carpenter's Avork; not unfrequently he
invaded the work-room, Avhere matter Avas in course of
undergoing such treatment as Avould render it suitable
for association with the cultured organisms of
carnivorous, graminivorous man. There he so took affairs
into his own hands, that Avhen those he served, applied
themselves to the occupation of reinvigorating nature
and restoring her exhausted forces, matter was presented
for the purpose so modelled and manipulated as to
render the task of applying it a gratifying sensation;
while another sense Avas delighted, and æsthetical
perceptions ministered to, by the appearance of beautiful
floral arrangements thrown into high relief by the snowy
whiteness of the table drapery; that no disappointment
might be felt as to the style, species or succession of
art specimens destined to approve themselves to the
palates of his employers. Francois daily, in his own
language, Avrote an indication of Avhat might be
expected, and placed it to his master's hand; not only
did he do all this, but he succeeded in extracting such
an amount of labour from the country lad Avho had
succeeded the coachman, that, speaking in the
barbarous vernacular of the commonalty, the boy declared,
in lugubrious accents, "that there furriner rin him off
his legs, and worked him, that'en wasn't an ounce
o' flesh a-sticking to his bones; he wasn't nought but an
atomy," by which he meant to express that he was an
atomy, whatever may be the meaning of that term.

  CHAPTER III.  
  
  
  A RESTLESS SQUIRE DESTROYS REPOSE.  
  
  
  " 'Tis love, 'tis love, tis love
That makes the world go round."
Old Song.  
  
  
  " Omnia vincit amor."—Virgil.

Miss Lewisham was alone in her draAving-room. She
was seated in a high-backed, precise-looking arm-chair,
bearing (at least, so Ada thought) some sort of
resemblance to Aunt Jane herself; for this arm-chair had not
an unkind or very uncomfortable aspect, but it looked a
little set and particular in its notions, as if it had got
into its groove and meant to stop there, and would not
like to have its existing place changed, or to be moved
about the room very suddenly. Opposite stood the
modern piece of furniture that had been procured for
Ada. It looked across the room with a free and easy,
half-amused air, and—made itself comfortable; the other
chairs were all of stained Avood, Avith hard light-blue
cushions; the window hangings were blue or bluish, the
carpet grey or greyish; on the Avails hung a feAv good
pictures, mostly dark old landscapes by Dutch painters;
several good pieces of china Avere about the room, and a
jar of flowers on the centre-table. Although it was the
height of summer, the room looked not cool, but cold;
and with the exception of Ada's chair, all the articles it
contained conveyed the impression that they Avere saying,
\"We are in our places, Ave must not be moved! do take
care, you will break us if you move us !"
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 28 -->

The blind was down. Aunt Jane was placed with
her back to the light, and held a piece of paper before
her eyes as a screen. She was not asleep, and not
awake. The component parts of her cogitations ran into
one another.


\"Young Forbes—kind and respectful to old people—
here very often—do not know—-young people so
different at present time—that Mr. Morgan—very odd—
do not hke each other—Avhat did Forbes mean—John
—my Ada—dear child—sitting on rose trees—yes—
not keep her here always, if providence will permit—
young men—flighty little body, very pleasant though,
cannot believe all—if I am spared—spared—spared."  
  
  
  Aunt Jane slumbered.


A sharp ring at the door-bell sounded through the
house.  
  
  
  Aunt Jane started.  
  
  
  " What's that ? Who's come now ?"


Thompson opened the door and announced Mr.
SelAvynson.


\"Oh ! ah ! Avho ?—John, is it really you ? I am very
glad to see you; Avhen did you come back ?"


"Yesterday," said the neAv-comer, shaking Aunt Jane's
hand rather vigorously.


He was a broad-shouldered, strongly made man of
middle height, with an active, brisk, rather soldier-like
bearing, a round face, merry smile and light hair.


\"What have you and Ada been doing Avith
yourselves ? Shall I pull up a blind ?"


\"You can raise it a little way, if the sun is gone in.
You see, I have suffered from my eyes, and am obliged
to take care: and July sun spoils the curtains—but you
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 29 -->
young men do not understand about those things; indeed,
Iioav should you? What have I and my blessing, Ada, been
doing ? Well, she has been gardening a great deal. It
is such a comfort to me that she has so many resources,
and can occupy herself. We have been a few drives;
Mrs. Seymour and Walter Forbes have been here. I
am a little afraid of my dear Ada finding it dull; but
she always was quiet, not like some of the girls of the
present day, who can never rest, and want to fly about
everywhere."  
  
  
  " No, Ada is not a flying-about sort."


\"Still, I have been thinking," and Aunt Jane's right
forefinger began to tap the palm of her left hand. " I
have been thinking—that if I should be spared —and
my eyes should keep pretty well, and everything should
go well—we might possibly go somewhere for a little
just now. Ada, you knoAv, has been used to taking
journeys, and she is one of those persons you can
depend upon. Anson, has travelled a great deal—
she is ahvays wanting to go about more; she has
been used to it all her life till she came here, you
see.


\"So you and Ada mean to go off for a lark. Well
done ! you couldn't do better!"


\"It is not settled-—you must not regard it as settled.
I have not mentioned it to any one but yourself yet. I
Avanted just to ask you Avhat you thought about it.
We should be three women together, Avithout any
manservant or gentleman. In my young days ladies would
never have dreamt of travelling so. But I am told that
they go all over the world now, without thinking of
having a man Avith them."
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 30 -->

\"I am sure you would find no difficulty. I will go
and look at rooms for you anywhere, if you like."


\"Thank you, my dear, but you must not regard it as
a settled thing. There is much to be considered; I
do not like acting in a random way. I only thought I
should just like to ask you priArately, first, what view
you took of the matter ?"


At this moment Ada entered the room, and quietly
shook hands Avith John, who rose to meet her quickly
and eagerly.


Thompson came into the room directly afterwards,
and, giving Ada a note, said the bearer was waiting for
an answer. She read it; then, turning to Aunt Jane,
said:


\"It is from Mrs. Seymour. She offers me her pony
to ride to-morrow, and says if I like to have it,
Catherine Gresford and her brother Avill call for me at
half-past three o'clock, and that the pony shall be sent
here a little previously. I think I shall go."  
  
  
  Mr. Selwynson looked a little dissatisfied.


\"Do you know anything about the pony; has it ever
carried a lady ?" he asked.  
  
  
  " Oh yes; Mrs. Seymour rides it constantly."


\"Kate and Harry Gresford are rather madcaps upon
horseback; you must mind what you are doing," said
John.


"You had better not go, my dear, if your cousin
does not think it quite safe, particularly on a strange
animal. The creature may be restiAre with a new
rider, and you have not ridden for so long," said Aunt
Jane.  
  
  
  " It would hardly be civil to refuse Mrs. Seymour's
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 31 -->
kind offer, and dear Aunt Jane, I have not forgotten
how to ride;" and Ada wrote a note accepting the
proposition.


John Selwynson remarked that he Avould take a look
at the old bay horse, and suggested that Ada should
accompany him.


\"You are going to give me some dinner, Aunt Jane,
and remember that I am very hungry," he said, as he
left the room with his cousin.


Ada and John did not at once visit the building
appropriated to the accommodation of horses. They
stood in the hall talking in low tones, and John,
although not apparently taking leave, again greeted his
cousin, and more affectionately than before. As they
left the out-buildings after inspecting the horse, and
John's own strong chestnut mare, he again referred
to the matter that had disturbed him in the
draAvingroom.


"She would carry you/' he began, alluding to the
chestnut; " although she's so strong, she's a light mouth
and easy paces. A lady rode her before I got her. I
would leave her for you, only I do not know how I should
get home. I wish I could come, but I can't get away
tomorrow; I must see into several things, and I have two
meetings."


\"Why are you so anxious about that wretched little
pony ? If Mrs. Seymour can ride it, surely I can ?"


\"I don't doubt you can ride it, but—where's Forbes ?
is he going ?"


\"His mother does not say so, but I should think he
most likely is."  
  
  
  " I thought so. Well, look here, Ada, don't ride his
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 32 -->
horses again; if you Avant to ride, send to me and let
me mount you."


\"My dear John, you are too absurd. I am not going
to ride Mr. Forbes' horse; if I Avas, I cannot see Avhy you
should mind. I am going to ride Mrs. Seymour's pony."
Ada looked annoyed.


\"It is all the same. Has Forbes made up his mind
what to do, and is anything settled about his
marriage ? I Avas told the old squire would much like to
send him to the right about."


\"I do not know if anything is settled. I suppose he
has no income to marry on just yet. He and Kate seem
very happy; they are always going about together."


\"I cannot understand a man living on his mother,
and doing nothing for himself, when he Avants to marry
a pretty girl like Kate."  
  
  
  "He means to Avrite books."


\"He has not Avritten any; besides, I call that doing
nothing. He's a queer chap."


\"Do you think we could start a floAver sIioav here,
John, and make it a branch of your society ?"


\"You could join our society; this parish is too near
for another show to answer. Do people here want to
start a horticultural society ? Whose idea is it ?"  
  
  
  " I was talking to—Mr. Morgan about it."  
  
  
  " Who is Morgan ?"  
  
  
  " The new curate."  
  
  
  " A curate, a muff, I suppose; would he do any good ?"  
  
  
  " I don't know; he has not been here very long."


\"We shall have to go into the house in a minute.
Ada, I came to say, do let this mystery be at an end,
pray do!"
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 33 -->

"John, you promised that we should say nothing
about it for six months, and only three have passed;
the reasons for my wish remain just the same—Aunt
Jane must not be fussed or troubled; her doctor says
she must not."


\"1 do not see why she should be troubled. I think
she has guessed already," persisted John.


\"If she thought I was going to leave her it would fuss
her dreadfully. She gets fussed by such little things."


\"I think you are mistaken in thinking this Avould
fuss her. I want my position acknowledged; it would
be better for us both, it would indeed."


Ada laid her hand on his arm. " Let us keep our
secret these three months longer. I like to think it
over in my heart and feel happy; and you promised."


\"I shall not be able to keep my promise. I shall be
sure to let it out to Aunt Jane some day, or do
something to make her find it out. I never could see the
use of a mystery about nothing."


\"John, in the far future I shall have to do all you
want; let this one thing be as I would have it."


\"My dearest," replied John, " in that future, which I
hope is not so distant, I Avill do all you Avant."
SomehoAv, John was conquered, though not convinced. 

Dinner Avas over. The chestnut mare was at the
door waiting to take her master home. Her master Avas
standing before Miss Lewisham, a little impatiently,
receiving last words of instruction, about several small
matters of business, to which he did not give quite his
usual careful, intelligent attention.  
  
  
  John's face was a little disturbed; and though Ada's  
  
  
  was calm, moisture trembled on her eye-lids as she  
  
  
  o
O
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 34 -->
said good-bye. Somehow those two had not hit it off
quite smoothly on that summer day. John Sehvynson
had ridden from his home that morning with a very
firm determination that he would have his own way,
and he had not got it.


If that curious complaint which is beyond reach of
pharmaceutical science to heal, and outside of the
stretch of reason to control or account for, does indeed
produce power to act on the circular motions of our
globe, we may conclude that with increase of propellant
force the rotatory movements would be more or less
rapid, so that as at that time our friend, Mr. Sehvynson
was applying the force in a considerable degree, the
Avorld was probably turning its inhabitants giddy by
the activity of its revolutions.


Mr. John Selwynson was the reigning squire of the
village of Serwyncombe. His father had married Miss
Lewisham's sister for his second wife.


John, as quite a young man, had been in the army for
a short period; he had afterwards acted for some years as
his father's agent, showing a good deal of capacity for
business, and exercising sound practical common sense
as to the arrangements, and transactions he dealt with.
He was not permitted during his father's lifetime to
make many changes or alterations, although some were
urgently needed. During the three years, he had now
been his own master, he had made several, thereby
much promoting the well-being of his tenants.


Old Mr. Selwynson Avas the trusted and very intimate
friend, of the Misses Lewisham. They were rich—he
kept their affairs in order for them, and they consulted
him upon all occasions. After his marriage Avith the
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 35 -->
eldest, when age and growing infirmities, prevented him
from attending so much to business, his own affairs and
also those of the remaining Miss LeAvisham, slipped into
the hands of John.


John, although son to the first Mrs. Selwynson, had
long been considered as a nephew by Miss Lewisham,
while Ada was called his cousin, although in reality in
no wise related to him, being the daughter of Miss
Lewisham's brother.


Ada had intimately known John Selwynson as long
as she could remember. Her home had been with an
elder brother—the pastor of a hamlet adjoining that of
Selwyncombe, at which place a great portion of her time
had been spent with her aunt—-Mrs. Sehvynson the
second. The pastor had married late in life, and after
his marriage Ada transferred herself from his house to
that of Aunt Jane, who had long Avanted her.


I think fever had been latent in John Selwynson's
veins, for some time before the complaint began
demonstratively to manifest itself, seemingly called forth by
the unpleasant excitation, his whole nature underwent
in beholding another desirous of appropriating the
treasure he had learnt to consider his when he choose
to lay claim to it. To the audacious pretender, however,
Ada showed no favour; while John was very dear to
her, and she replied in the affirmative to the eager
question he asked.


We have before said Ada had seen the leaves bud out
on the bare branches, fall and bud again, some twenty-five
times; John had perhaps done so thirty times. He had
ever required many services at Ada's hand, and she had
willingly performed them; so summer after summer  
  
  
  3—2

had slipped away in cousinly friendship. Suddenly, as it
seemed to her, he asked for more than he had ever asked
before. He asked her to be his, and implored that she
would one day swear to obey him till death. She loved
him—better than her brother—almost better than Aunt
Jane. Was she to make him unhappy by refusing what
he wished so greatly ? and then came the after-thought;
in some points of view, Avould be so great an
advantage for herself ? No, she only asked that things might
go on as they had done for so many years, six months
longer; she was in no hurry to be considered engaged.
She wanted to think. John granted the six months, and
noAv they seemed insupportable to him.


A very fussy man rode back to Selwyncombe through
the calm July evening. The sun had sunk beneath the
horizon; long narrow bars of dark cloud crossed the
fast-fading golden and rose colour of the east. The air
was pleasant and cool, laden Avith the odour of
honeysuckles; rabbits had come out of their burrows, and were
rejoicing themselves in the fields. The rumble of a
distant hay wagon, and the shout of the driver to his horses
as the last load Avas taken home, were the only sounds
that broke the still delight of the twilight. Yet the man
on the chestnut mare, noticed not the sunset clouds, nor
did the cool, balmy air still his restlessness; he was
vexed and ill at ease. " Why should any one speak to
Ada Avithout recognising her as his 1 Why should she
ride Walter Forbes' horses ? and that Morgan come and
go and arrange with her about flower shows ?"


Next morning some necessary business claimed Mr.
Selwynson's attention; Avith some effort he mastered
himself to give his mind to it, and felt better.

  CHAPTEE IV.  
  
  
  RIDING AND RIDERS.—REFLECTIONS.  
  
  
  " And circumstance, that unspiritual god
And mis-creator, makes and helps along
Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod."
Byron.

The following day Proputty duly came to Miss
Lewisham's house at the time appointed. Almost at
the same moment Catherine Gresford put in an
appearance, accompanied by Walter and her young
brother, Harry.  
  
  
  " Where shall Ave go ?" was asked.


\"Across Morningford Common and back by Pilkington
Hill was a pleasant ride," suggested Harry.


Ada was consulted, and said she did not care, but
there would be more shade in Gosford Long Lane.


Nevertheless, the common was agreed upon, and the
party set forth, Ada and Harry to the front. Ada did
not appear at her best on horseback: she had not ridden
enough to look thoroughly at ease; she was a little too
tall in the saddle, and did not sit quite square. She
always thought that she was very fond of riding; but I
am not sure that she did not deceive herself.


Kate Gresford, on Farmer Johnson's raw colt, looked
greatly to advantage, as comfortable as if she had been
in an arm-chair, Avhile the colt's little shies and young
horse ways, only amused her, and brought out her
merry, pretty musical laugh. Walter Avatched her
with fond, proud pleasure, and acknowledged that no
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 38 -->
prettier sight could meet one's eyes than his Katie on
horseback, her bright hair and blush-rose complexion
looking their best under the little black hat, her habit
showing up the perfection of her figure, her face lit up
with pleasurable excitement.


Kate and Walter did not talk much; a Avord or two
of criticism on Ada's riding was exchanged, a word or
two respecting the young horse, his paces, action, etc.
Then Walter gave himself up to silent meditation and
contemplation of his companions, of the hedge-rows,
full of Avild roses, honeysuckles and trails of briony, of
the cattle grouped in restful attitudes under the shade
of trees, and of things in general. By degrees he fell
into a sort of misty day-dream.


Were things real or unreal ? Was this indeed
himself ? Was this fair vision by his side his betrothed
wife ? Were all things as they seemed, or were
perceptions of form as delusive as the phantoms of mind
and imagination.


In the meantime, Ada and Harry Gresford had been
very sociable. He had given her a history of a recent
cricket match, recounted all the exploits his pony was
capable of, if it had not performed them, and amused
her by much bright boyish chatter.


They came to the edge of the common. The lad
turned round:


"Now, Kate, we must have a canter. Let us see
what yours goes like."  
  
  
  Walter looked at Kate.


\"You feel quite at home ? You are sure you can
hold him ? The ground is hard for going fast, even
on the turf."
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 39 -->

\"Oh yes, I can hold him; he has a light mouth.
Good-bye !"


\"Good-bye!" he answered, his lively little cob
plunging and rearing Avith impatience to follow its
fellows.


The eager pair started side by side in a steady gallop.
He watched them nervously for a moment, then came
beside Ada.


\"We Avill not follow their example, Miss Lewisham.
I do not want to excite the young horse more than can
be helped. How do you like Proputty ? My mother
thinks him most valuable property."


\"So should I, if he were mine. He really belonged
to a northern farmer, did he not ?"


"Yes, a genuine northern farmer of the 'new
style.'"


\"What a delightful place this common is ! a little
spot undisturbed by civdisation."


\"Does the absence of civilisation make you like it
better ?"


\"Yes, I think it does. I should like to see a place
where man had really never been; where one could feel
that the trees, and plants, and animals had grown and
lived and died as they liked; that only "  
  
  
  " Only what ?"


\"That only—only their Creator had seen them. Do
you not think that in such a place one would feel a
sort of awe or reverence that one does not feel among
the haunts of men ?"


In ordinary social intercourse, when not especially
called upon to express his own thoughts, Walter had
contracted the rather unfair habit of often questioning
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 40 -->
the opinions of others, even though he might lean
towards agreement with them. Whether he did so
now I cannot tell; he answered :


\"I think those feelings, you call reverence, and awe,
would arise more from the unfamiliarity with the place,
from the mingled emotions of fear, and melancholy, at
being solitary in such a place, while from its grandeur
and wildness you derived a sensation of pleasure. The
excitement arising from this sort of mingling of emotions
is pleasurable, and people are apt to call it reverence and
awe. I doubt if the consideration that the spot you
stood in had never before been looked upon by any
other eye than that of a God would make much
difference in your feelings, although you might think so. I
have knoAvn people almost lose their senses during
storms among our north country mountains Avhen there
was no danger; it was merely the effect on their
nervous system of seeing nature in a passion. The scene
Avas wild and unfamiliar, and they Avere afraid."


\"But a very beautiful place does surely incline us to
higher, better thought; and you do not mean to say
that there is no such thing as reverence and aAve 1"


\"Excuse my saying I never heard a more Avomanly
speech than that. Reverence simply means
respectfulness, and respect for that which is higher than
ourselves is one of the best feelings in our nature; all I
meant to say is that I doubt the savage solitude you
Avish to be in really exciting a stronger sentiment of
respect for a divinity than such a scene as this, for
instance—cloud and blue sky, light, shade, colour, and,
closing in this one uncultivated spot, the rich fulness of
the earth God has given to man."
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 41 -->

Walter Forbes seemed a little irritated; there was a
pause.


\"Do you care much for landscape," he said at
length.


\"Yes, indeed I do; but not in the same Avay you do;
at least, I think not."  
  
  
  " Why, how do I care ?"
\"Oh, never mind."


\"You have excited my curiosity; you must tell me
now."


\"When you study landscape you seem a little like an
epicure tasting a new dish : having tasted, you want to
read the receipt; you criticise and consider all the
different parts."


\"Thank you, Miss Lewisham. Now tell me how you
look at nature 1" and Walter coloured slightly.


\"In a much more simple way. It only seems to me
very beautiful and Avonderful, but I feel strongly that
it is beautiful and wonderful."


\"And you feel better for the beauty and the wonder
of it ?"


\"Yes; in a beautiful place I think I feel more
reA'erent. I suppose you will say I deceive myself
about that ?"


\"No, I shall not. You revere the Author because an
exemplification of His love and power is before you."


\"Do you think because I like to observe the
component parts of beauty I am irreverent, that I am no
better for the beauty and Avonder ?"  
  
  
  " No, but I think you are like ' The Palace of Art.'"
\"Please explain."  
  
  
  " You Avatch everything, as if a great game of chess
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 42 -->
Avas going on in which you were interested as a looker
on, not as a player. ' O all things fair to sate and
please my eyes,' you knoAv the rest."


He turned away his head for an instant before
replying, in a low constrained voice:


\"You are severe and unsparing; that I cannot force
myself to pursue the occupations by Avhich those
practical men, you admire, help or hinder, their fellows in the
march of life, is my misfortune, more than my fault."


Seeing he was Avounded, some sudden impulse made
Ada hold out her hand, saying, Avith a sweet half smile,
"You have power and capability to do so much, Mr.
Forbes, forgive me if I have vexed you. Here come
the others."


\"He is a darling," called out Kate, as she approached.
\"His gallop is perfect; I could teach him to canter in
no time; he has a nice mouth, and only wants making.
I do hope papa Avill let me have him."


"He's a good looking animal, and moves well,"
answered Walter, smiling at his betrothed's flushed
excited face; " but, my dear Kate, what a state of heat
you and Harry have got your unfortunate animals
into."


Harry jumped off his pony, gathered a wisp of rushes,
and Aviped the foam off the creatures' bits and necks.


\"Now they'll look all right before we get to
Morningford," he said.


From off the common, there was a steep descent into
the valley, where the small town of Morningford lay;
at the top of the hill the riders paused.


Very fair Avas the scene before them. At their feet
lay the quaint old town of ancient dAvellings Avith high
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 43 -->
pitched roofs, the fashion of the architecture imported
by emigrant artizans of far-off years. In the centre of
the town rose the grey spire of a magnificent church; a
little river flowed through the valley, passing under the
Avails of old grey stone factories with innumerable
windows. The eye might range far over undulating
country, divided into pastures, and fields of green waving
grain,the divisions effected byAvalls of looselypiled stones
—here and there patches of woodland; small clusters of
houses forming hamlets, large stately mansions Avith
backgrounds of fine trees—to the far distance where a
broad winding line of silver told that a great river Avas
hastening to the sea; beyond that the faint indistinct
outline of mountains. It was far different to the place
Ada had Avished to see; no nature in untamed strength
was to be seen here: it was nature trained, modified and
modelled by the hand of man, lit up in some places by
the glorious sunshine, in others shaded by the shadoAV
of cloud.


\"It's a jolly view, but a stiffish hunting country,"
said Harry.


The party descended the decline, passed through the
town, and entered the wood surrounding Pilkington
Hill


Walter got off Dabchick, gave the rein to Harry, and
sought for the sweet white orchis for Avhich these Avoods
were famed; he found many, and some marsh violets,
all of which Avere disposed of in Kate's hat, Avrapped up
in dock leaves.


\"Nothing hke a chimney-pot for stuffing things into,"
remarked Harry, bearing in mind Rugby reminiscences.  
  
  
  Little was said during the ride home; even the
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 44 -->
schoolboy's wild spirits Avere subdued by the quiet of the
evening hour, when the notes of the thrush were  
  
  
  " Few and strong and fine,
Gilt with sweet da/s decline,
And sad with promise of a different sun."


Walter had perhaps studied Ada's character
sufficiently. He did not attempt another conversation with
her, but rode by Kate's side, listening to the remarks
she made from time to time to Ada. Harry was in
front, his pony pulling and fretting to hasten home.


Catherine gave Ada a liberal half of the flowers before
they separated.


In his study that evening, Walter read through the
\"Palace of Art," dAvelling upon the verses :  
  
  
  " O all things fair to sate and please my various eyes !

O shapes and hues that please me well!
0 silent faces of the Great and Wise,

My Gods, with whom I dwell !  
  
  
  " O God-like isolations which art mine,

I can but count thee perfect gain;
What time I watch the darkening droves of swine,

That range on yonder plain."


\"She is wrong, quite wrong," he said. " I do not
despise men, or examine them, as naturalists do bird
skins. I feel, and want all to feel, how lovely a thing
a perfected human nature Avould be; how divine and
good Avas the thought of the Deity Avhen he originated
the idea of man; how grievous is the divergement of
the creature from the will of the Creator. Nature is
true, and God is true, and truth is hidden in the mind
of man. I seek for it there, and would teach others to
see it."  
  
  
  In the same strain Walter mused on for some time,
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 45 -->
philosophically meditating upon the gift mankind has
of seeing, not what is, but Avhat they are taught to see,
or what they teach themselves to see; Iioav what is
called falsity, by one age, or by one nation is held to be
fact by another; how what one mind has seen, to be
clearest verity, another of equal intellectual poAver, has
held to be grossest error, only, apparently, because the
two minds were trained in different schools, under
different conditions. He repeated Pilate's question,
\"What is truth ?" he made to himself Wordsworth's
inquiry " What is error ?"  
  
  
  " We live by admiration, love and hope,
And what is error V


He told himself it was the self-mastered man and
trained intellect that could set aside delusions, and
look for truth. He resolved that, Avere it granted to
him, to find glimmerings of the truth, after humbly and
diffidently seeking for it, he would point it out to
others. He considered that perfect beauty, is perfect
truth, and came to the conclusion that truth has
not much to do Avith things as they are, but appears
for a moment, when the smile of the Infinite, is mirrored
on the soul of the finite.


At this stage in his reflections he opened the glass
door and stood out in the moonlight. The smell of
flowers flooded the night air; in all earnestness, he
breathed a prayer for guidance.


\"Spirit of love and purity aid me, for I am weak;
guide me, for I am ignorant. If I have sought my own
good too much, and only thought of helping others in
the future, forgive me, teach me to speak, teach me to
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 46 -->
Avorship. Old friend, can you see me ? did you learn
the day after death, the meaning of all that is puzzling
here ? I am yearning, and longing, to push a little
nearer, to the truth, you taught me to seek for. Can
you grasp, what I seek ? Oh, my friend, bless me, bless
me, help me on my way !"  
  
  
  CHAPTER V.  
  
  
  THE SABBATH.—PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.— AUNT JANE'S  
  
  
  SURMISES ARE CONFIRMED.  
  
  
  " An' I niver knaw'd whot a mean'd, but I thowt a 'ad summut  
  
  
  
to saay,
An' I thowt a said whot a owt to a' said, an' I corned awaay."
Tennyson, Northern Farmer.  
  
  
  " A sleepy land, where under the same wheel,
The same old rut would deepen year by year."
Ibid, Aylmer's Field.

The daAvn of the Sabbath broke over the land.


Quietly did the villagers aAvake from their slumbers
and prepare themselves for rest after toil, freedom after
task-work.


A school, a church, and about tAventy houses
composed the scattered little hamlet of Berwerton. The
old manor, of which Walter Forbes was proprietor, was
the most imposing dwelling; Miss Lewisham's was
second of importance; Farmer George's new white
house ranked third; then came Robin Owen's, the
blacksmith's, Charles Davis, the carpenter's, day
labourer's cottages, and the school-house. The church
was a small brick building, lighted by narrow,
roundheaded Avindows placed in couplets in the nave; the tiny
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 47 -->
chancel terminated in an apse pierced Avith six small
windows; the vestry occupied one transept, the organ
the other. A small wooden spire rose over the single
hell. The edifice somewhat resembled some of the
small churches on the banks of the Rhine.


At thirty minutes past ten of the clock, Robin Owen
issued from his door clad in black broad-cloth from head
to foot. He entered the church and pulled the bell for
some five minutes; he then looked out the lessons for
the day, and pulled the bell for another five minutes;
he then laid out the priestly robes, and removed
coverings from the altar and kneeling cushions, and again
rang the bell till the clock struck eleven.


When the bell first sounded, some slight stir took
place in the village; tidy-looking Avomen called in small
children to be dressed to " go to church with father;"
lounging men in Sunday waistcoats and clean shirts
made a move; some entered their houses to don coats
and hats. When the second bell ceased, the school
door opened, Catherine Gresford and her elder sister,
Maude, came out, and went to the church, speedily
folloAved by a procession of children. When the last
bell sounded, one or more persons emerged from nearly
every house in the village, one or two farmers from
outlying farms, drove up in dog-carts, bringing wives and
daughters; the squire came in his low carriage.


When the bell was sdent, the low soft tones of the
organ, played by Maude Gresford, sounded through the
church, followed by Mr. Morgan's sonorous accents,
addressing his " dearly beloved brethren."


Very beautiful is the service of the State Church in
England, wherewith, in the alternations of prayer and
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 48 -->
praise, she seeks to call forth the expression of her
members' worship of the Divinity.


Had all that rural congregation been called upon
suddenly to avow their utter faith in the creed they most
of them audibly repeated, their belief that the forms of
devotion adhered to in that temple were those most
calculated to meet the spiritual needs of man and
support his soul in the road from earth to heaven, all
except one or two church-going Methodists Avould
probably have replied with an unhesitating
affirmative.


Rich and poor were met together in the temple of
their God, the King of kings, the Lord of lords; He
who in undoubting faith they believed to be the
disposer of existences. They bowed themselves before
Him in unanimous worship. What a beautiful idea.


Their bodies bowed, rose and fell as the rubric
prescribed; they acted the expression of Christian
devotion very respectably. They stood up to chant the
Psalms, chanting to the low wail of a minor chant:


\"Be merciful unto me, 0 God, for man goeth about
to devour me: he is daily fighting and troubling
j,
me...  
  
  
  The chant changed.


\"Are your minds set upon righteousness, 0 ye
congregations; and do ye judge the thing that is right, 0
ye sons of men ?"


Walter Forbes glanced round the church; of the
school children, some were yawning, some trying to
attract each other's attention, others looked stolid, quiet,
and indifferent. Of the adults, many were joining in
the chanting, all Avere orderly; some had on set Sunday
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 49 -->
faces, and eyes fixed on their Prayer-book; some
seemed to be thinking of something apart from the
occupation of the present. A Miss George had her eyes
fixed upon the new bonnet of a Miss Price, while Miss
Price seemed to be critically examining Kate's attire.


Walter caught a low whisper behind him, " I've
watched him three Sundays: he's always looking at
her." He could read scant trace of religious enthusiasm
upon any face but Ada's, although Kate's expression of
simple reverence pleased him well; Miss Lewisham he
could not see.


Among the countenances open to his observation in
that assembly, there were few less expressive of any
kind of fervour, few more indifferent and apathetic, than
that of the priest dedicated to the service of the
temple; his voice was sonorous and solemn, he read
inattentively, here and there omitting a word oraccentin" wron" ones.

o O


The people sat down, while a page was read to them
from the chronicles of an ancient people; they learnt
how the spirit of evil stood up against that nation, and
inspired its king with a desire to count his subjects.
He yielded to his desire, and by so doing displeased the
Great Power that nation worshipped. A messenger
from the Great Power, came to the king and offered
choice of three dreadful punishments, all of which
would involve the nation in more misery than the
individual transgressor. The king chose that three
days' pestilence should pass over the land. By the
decree of the Great Power the pestilence swept over
the people, and seventy thousand human creatures were
slain. " Then the destroyer paused," says the chronicle.

<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 50 -->

Walter looked sad and thoughtful as the relation
ended. He looked round about him. No sort of emotion
could be traced upon any face. All were quite unmoved
by the recital of that history. It was a familiar one,
and excited neither wonder nor question.  
  
  
  Triumphantly rose the glorious chant:


\"We praise Thee, O God: we acknowledge Thee to
be the Lord; All the earth doth worship Thee, the
Father everlasting."


Another prayer was read, and shortly afterwards the
people knelt down to pray, rising to sing that beautiful
hymn, " Lead kindly Light, lead Thou me on," etc.


After service, there were greetings in the churchyard,
and people told each other bits of news. The Gresford
girls were to stay with Mrs. Seymour till the second
service, at Berwerton Hall, Squire Gresford's house,
was a long two miles distant from the village. Mrs.
Seymour insisted upon having a middle-of-the-day dinner
on Sundays, and late cold supper. She said it was less
trouble to the servants, and perhaps it was so; at all
events, from that uncomfortable meal, a formal mid-day
dinner, Mrs. Seymour ever appeared to derive the glow
of satisfaction produced by consciousness of having
assisted at the performance of a virtuous action.


While waiting to be summoned to this repast, Mrs.
Seymour and her guests sat in the garden, Walter
standing near. The ladies spoke of Mr. Morgan;
Catherine said she "wondered that Mr. Moore put up
with a curate of that stamp."


\"Mr. Moore had been so long without a curate," said
Maude; " and really, if Mr. Morgan would read more
carefully, I do not see that there is much to take
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 51 -->
exception at in the way he does the service; then he
does not interfere with everything we do, as Mr. Benson
did."


\"What did you think of the way he read the ' first
lesson ?' " Walter said.


\"The ' first lesson V " said his mother and Kate
together. " What was the ' first lesson V " i  
  
  
  Maude answered:


\"It was about David numbering Israel. I do not
remember that Mr. Morgan blundered particularly over
reading it, did he ?"


\"No," said Walter; " not very particularly. He laid
accent upon all the words in italics, as he always does
when he is not thinking about what he is doing. What
do you think of the history contained in the ' first
lesson ?'"


\"I—-I do not know. It seemed a very awful
punishment for the fault David had fallen into; but we
cannot always enter into or understand the severe
justice of the Old Testament."  
  
  
  " Justice ?" said Walter.


\"Walter!!!" said his mother, taking exception at his
tone rather than at his words; " it is perfectly shocking
to hear you speak. What is in the Bible must be good
and right; we are creatures of His hand, made of clay,
and are we to pass judgment on the acts of the
Creator ?"  
  
  
  They were called to dinner.


Walter did not go to the afternoon service; with
Lessing's " Education of the Human Race" in his
hand, he retreated to the shade of a favourite tree. I
do not think " Lessing" obtained much of his attention.  
  
  
  4. '>
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 52 -->
His thoughts flowed dreamily—a little disconnectedly;
they were not thoughts that had arisen then for the first
time, but repetitions slightly varied of some time of more
intellectual activity. If no previous distrustfulness of the
notions imbibed in childhood had entered his brain, and if
during that hot July afternoon one could have read to
him Genesis and Scriptural writings en suite, closing the
book at the end of the forty-second chapter of Job,
Walter Forbes might have listened with that sort of
attention people give to the lessons of Scripture read
in church, and not cavilled at a single passage; exterior
causes so acted upon his thinking powers that he hardly
could have roused himself to exert any mental activity.
But, alas! the notions derived from his mother in
childhood had been disturbed; those that had succeeded
them now roamed lazily through his brain in this wise :


"The letter killeth, the spirit giveth life." Thousands
and thousands of cultured people, many wise and good
people, have listened to these things for hundreds of
years, and accepted them as literal truths—wonderful!
It is "the fool that saith in his heart there is no God."


We cannot look beyond the limits of knowledge and
know. I feel, I believe the attributes of the God of
nature, the God I -worship, are mercy, love, and truth.
These old stories would make him out to be a despotic
tyrant.


\"There is another bud of Baroness Rothschild out; in
full sunshine a pink rose does not look more orange
than in dusk-light, the texture of the petals does not
reflect the colour of light. Oh, fellow mortals, would
that you and I could separate truth from fiction,
without sweeping away both—behind the veil, behind the
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 53 -->
veil She has no doubt—psalms—her face beautiful."
Stretched upon the greensward, Walter Forbes went to
sleep, and awoke an hour later to find his mother had
returned from church and was standing looking at him.


\"Why, mother, are you come back! What a lazy
fellow I am," he said, rising. " Where are Maude and
Kate V


\"Maude is going to play the organ for an hour, and
Kate is blowing for her. I want to talk to you, Walter.
I have been thinking that we ought to give a party of some
kind, and I think we might have a garden-party next
Wednesday; also, there is another thing we have been
saying—how charming it would be if we all went to
Aix for a fortnight.'"


\"Dear little woman, you take away my breath.
You go to church to form such plans as these, do you ?
A garden-party next Wednesday ? be it so. But
where are the people to come from ? Don't let them
stick white arches in the grass plat and knock balls
into the flower beds; do not let them gather the
Baroness Rothschild, or come into the library."


\"Do not be silly, Walter; of course they won't go into
the library, or gather the roses. Kate wants so much
to go to a party where lawn tennis is well played, so I
am glad you like the idea. Of course, it is a very short
invitation, but I think a good many people will come."


\"Kate wants a party, does she ? Why does not her
father give one ? And who is it, mutterchen, that
wants to go to Aix ?"


\"We all do; Maude, Catherine, Miss Lewisham, and
Ada; and we have nearly settled to go, whether you
come or not, so there !"
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 54 -->

\"My dear mother, am I still asleep ? do I hear you
say Miss Lewisham—that Aunt Jane, proposes to go to
foreign lands ?"


\"She wants to take Ada somewhere. She has
rheumatism so badly sometimes, and I told her there was
nothing like the baths at Aix for curing all kinds of
rheumatism. I was there twice with Mr. Seymour;
they cured him, and the Virgin Mary's chemise was
hung out from the top of the cathedral both times."


\"Because Mr. Seymour's rheumatism was cured ?
Will they do so when Ada Lewisham is cured ? do you
think she will like it ?"


\"I did not say Ada had got rheumatism; it is Aunt
Jane. I had it down my left arm very badly last
winter. I asked Dr. Jelf about it, and he said
nothingwould do me so much good as the baths of Aix."


\"Did he think they would act as a preventative,
because you have not got rheumatism now ? But, mother,
if you want to go, we will think it over. It would be
rather fun. I should like of all things to see Aunt
Jane in foreign lands, though I expect, when things
come to a point, her heart will fail her, and she will
not go. Why must we pitch upon Aix ?—it is a dull
town."


\"Aix is near and accessible, and the baths there are
what Miss Lewisham wants. I think she will go. She
would do a great deal to please Ada. I wonder if she
will leave Ada all she has ?"


\"Well, if you decide upon going, I will escort you
there, but I stipulate that we travel by ourselves. I will
not take care of a dozen ladies. I shall now go and
hear Maude play, and shall walk part of the way back
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 55 -->
with her and Kate. Come with me to the gate,
mother, if you are not tired," and he placed her hand
on his arm, and made her walk with him to the gate
and a little beyond it.


When Walter entered the church, Maude was
playing and singing Schubert's "Ave Maria." She sang well,
and played exquisitely, both on the organ and violin—
a piano she seldom touched. When the piece was
finished, he took Kate's place as blower, and asked
her and Maude to sing again, " Lead, kindly bght."


\"I wish I was really musical," he said, as they left
the church. " I can appreciate a hymn tune, and when
you, Maude, fill the church with grand harmony, I feel
awed and calmed, and I can imagine what exquisite
gratification one with a fine trained ear must derive
from a feast of musical sound. Every one should be
taught in early life to cultivate a taste for music, as,
though nature may do much for some, art does much
also. I always feel that I am devoid of a sixth sense."


\"I do not think you are quite devoid of it; although
you may not feel the power of music acutely, I believe
you feel it more than many people who profess to be
musical," said Maude.  
  
  
  Kate said:


\"People are great hypocrites about music; they say
such silly things to Maude, and make the most absurd
mistakes very often. The other day she was what I
call rambling on her fiddle, playing something out of
her own head; Miss Braider said she admired Beethoven
more than any composer, because there happened to be
a piece of Beethoven's lying on the table open.  
  
  
  Walter laughed.
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 56 -->

\"That was an extreme case; but there is a large
class of people who, with regard to art, pretend to
have greater knowledge than they possess, and act more
enthusiasm than they feel—idiots that they are. The
result is, art and artists are always suffering as much
from ' incompetent praise as from incompetent criticism.'
Katie, I hear you want to turn our domain into a bear
garden, and hit balls over string network."


\"No, I don't. I do not mean to play tennis before a
lot of people till I can play better. I do not want you
to have a garden-party, Walter. Your mother talked
about it, and I said it would be fun. I know those
sort of things are not in your line; and, oh—are you
really going abroad ? Mrs. Seymour said she thought
you were wishing for a change. She wants Aunt Jane
and Ada to go. Aunt Jane did not say no, but that she
must have time to think about it, aud that she could
not do things in a random way."


\"If we do go, could not you and Maude join us there ?
Persuade the sqitire, and make him come."


\"He would not," said Maude; " but I think it is just
possible he might let us and Harry go. We have never
been out of England; it would be delightful. What is
to be seen in Aix ? you have been there, have you not ?"


\"I was there for a night once; it is a quaint old
town. My mother has twice been there, and has
pleasant recollections of her visits; she saw the
underclothing of a saint hung out on the cathedral, and was
much impressed by the sight."


\"Did she really ?" said Kate. " How odd. I should
like to see that."  
  
  
  " Aix is a very Catholic town. I have no doubt we
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 57 -->
should see some equally strange exhibitions of
superstition and credulity."


\"Do not say Catholic, say Roman Catholic, Mr.
Forbes," said Maude, looking up.  
  
  
  " Roman Catholic," said Walter.


Our friends came near to the hall, a large straggling
house, added to by successive generations of squires.
The drive, grass plats, and creepers trained on the house
were all untidily and roughly kept.


Passing through the entrance-door you found
yourself in a large domed hall, in which there was an organ.
On the left side of the hall a door opened into the
ordinary family sitting-room, a good-sized disorderly
looking room. Walter always thought the " white
queen " from behind the looking-glass must dwell in
that room. If so, Maude Gresford was the " white
queen;" she was not apathetic or helpless, but without
method, tact, or neatness.


Walter's sense of the fitness of things had lately
been sorely aggrieved by seeing an arrangement of
bristles suitable for extracting foreign matter from parts
of the hand exposed to view on the morning-room
table for two successive days, till Catherine, following
his glance, exclaimed, " Oh, that's Maude's; she
brought it down in a book to mark her place," and
removed it.


Mrs. Gresford had been dead many years, and Maude
acted as mistress of the house; or rather, she did not
act: every one was their own mistress, and did as it
seemed fit to them to do.


An old cook sent up something at regular times for
Mr. Gresford's dinner and breakfast; now and then his
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 58 -->
family dined with him 5 but often, especially in
summer time, they had cold meat at all sorts of times,
or carried sandwiches in their pockets. Kate was the
most orderly member of the family.


That same Sunday evening, as Miss Lewisham and
Ada were together, the former said, speaking very
nervously and almost blushing :


\"My dear child, now you are come to live with me
you must regard me as a sort of mother, and tell me
anything a mother ought to know. I shall ever wish
to promote your welfare; glad as I am to have you
with me, I should not want to keep you here if some
other plan seemed more for your lasting good."  
  
  
  " Aunt Jane, I hardly know what you mean ?"


\"Niece Ada, that bright tint would hardly come in
your cheeks if you had not some idea as to my
meaning."  
  
  
  Ada's face became scarlet.  
  
  
  "Aunt Jane, John has been a traitor, and has told you."


\"Dear Niece Ada, John has told me nothing, so you
tell what he had to tell."


And Ada said words which conveyed to Miss
Lewisham a comprehension of the covenant that existed
between her niece and Mr. Selwynson.


\"You will keep my secret, Aunt Jane; I do not
want every one to know this just yet V entreated Ada.  
  
  
  " Does John not wish it announced as yet ?"


\"Oh, John would I veritably believe, like to engage
a crier to shout it about everywhere."


Aunt Jane drew herself up a little, Ada should not
have talked about shouting; it was a random way of
speaking.
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 59 -->

\"I think, my dear, you should be guided by John's
wishes. You must permit me to tell Mrs. Seymour
when we go to her garden-party, if I should have an
opportunity ?"


\"Mrs. Seymour ! Then I shall be done for; she will
contrive to let every one there know in ten minutes."


\"We will go away early, to spare your blushes. Let
me have my own way in this, Ada."  
  
  
  Ada got up and came close to her aunt.


\"If you want your own way, you must have it; I do
not think I ever heard you ask for it before. Give me
a kiss and your blessing, Aunt Jane, and I think I
shall go to bed."


\"God bless you, child; I believe you have chosen a
good, steady, trustworthy fellow, who will take care of
you, and be considerate and kind; I shall like to think
you have him to look to when it pleases Providence
totake me away."


As Ada paced her room that night before seeking
repose, her feelings were of a mixed kind. Doubtless
there was exultation in the thought that she, the poor
parson's sister, had drawn a prize which many good and
particular mothers in the county of M would envy
her the possession of; while all her friends would
rejoice and think she had done well for herself. And
Ada knew that she had done well for herself. It was
an honour and a triumph to be the object of John
Selwynson's affection; she loved him and trusted him,
She told herself she was happy, very happy; while she
said so, unbidden rose a sense of a regret—a sense of a
possibility that might have been and was not.

  WALTER FORBES.  
  
  
  CHAPTER VI.  
  
  
  THE GARDEN-PARTY. A MIDNIGHT WANDERER.  
  
  
  " The young, the happy, and the fair,
The old, the sad, the worn were there;
Some vacant, and some musing went,
And some in talk and merriment,
Nods, smiles, and greetings, and farewells !
And now and then, perhaps, there swells
A sigh, a tear "
Matthew Arnold.

MRS.SEYMOUR'sgarden-partyhas passed from an
expectation to a reality, from that which is to be, to that which is.


A numerous company had gathered before the old
manor house; young girls in bright pretty costumes,
elder ladies in splendid attire, nonchalant young men
in rural browns, dandy young men in black coats and
tall hats. Groups of country squires thrusting jokes at
each other, groups of girls and curates, groups of
younglaymen, groups of mammas, groups of geraniums, beds
of roses, masses of luxurious leafage, green turf, glow of
sunshine, a mingling of colour, a blue sky.


Lady Dashforth and her daughter arrived in the
middle of the day, and were to stay over the following
one.


Lawn tennis was set up. John Selwynson and Harry
Gresford were playing in a style that did credit to
themselves and excited the admiration of beholders.
It was a pitched battle, the combatants well matched,
the graceful school-boy's exceeding agility making up
for John's superior play.


Old and young flocked round to see. Even Aunt
-Jane grew eager in the fear her favourite, John, should
<!-- Leaf 69 -->
  
  THE GARDEN-PARTY.—A MIDNIGHT WANDERER. Gl

lose; she thought it the prettiest she had seen of these
new-fashioned games; " but surely she must be
mistaken in thinking she had been told that ladies
sometimes played at it ?"


"Do you ever play, Miss Ada?" said Mr. Morgan,
who had planted himself by her side.


"No; I should be too stupid; I cannot play well at
croquet."


\"You are modest. I have seen you play very well,
Miss Ada. It is a better game than this, there is more
play in it. I do not see any hoops, or we might get up
a game."


\"It is so hot, I like best being still and watching the
contest. Why do not you go and play at bowls, Mr.
Morgan ?"


\"I also should like to see the end of this match. I
observe, Miss Ada, you and I are often interested in the
same thing—umph—may I say that a harmony
subsists"


\"Oh, there is my brother; I must speak to him. You
would find that bowling-green in capital order."


John Selwynson made a fault; glanced at Ada, made
another fault. Harry began to serve, and won.


\"I have never before had an opportunity to
congratulate you. I hear she is perfectly lovely. Pray
introduce me ?"


The speaker was Lady Dashforth, looking most
imposing in stiff rustling silk. She laid her hand on
Walter's arm, and led him in search of Kate.


\"Your dear mother tells me she has not much society
here; but this gathering does not look like no society,
does it now ? Who is that lady in crumpled muslin with
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 62 -->
  
  a six-sided hat on ? She is gone behind those shrubs

now."


Walter felt sure that the lady was Maude Gresford;
he answered:


\"I do not know; I have hardly seen all our friends
yet. I perceive our rector there, I think you would
like to know him. May I bring him to you ?"


Lady Dashforth said she should much like to make
acquaintance with the rector presently; she was now
going to take a great liberty. She felt sure Walter
would excuse her, as an old friend of his mother's, saying
a few words to him upon the advisability of
formingdefinite plans of life. The judge's opinion (and her own
coincided with his) was that all young men should
follow some profession, " and in your case, Mr. Forbes,
it seems particularly desirable, and it is a subject of
regret to all your friends to see you hiding your talents
beneath a bushel."


Poor Walter ! he was in for it; he looked about for
means of escape, and attempted no defence, while the
lady harangued a little longer. Presently he saw Kate,
and said he would go and fetch her, if Lady Dashforth
would rest a little on a seat near at hand. He brought
Kate to her, bringing up the rector also.


Now from among some bushes, a strain of music
arose; it was the baud from the next village; they
played very creditably. The buzz of conversation
hushed for a moment or two, then continued.  
  
  
  John had secured Ada.


"Who was that; fat fellow you were talking to,
Ada ?"  
  
  
  " Mr. Morgan. John, you were right: Aunt Jane has
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 63 -->
guessed, and you are going to have your own way; every
one will know soon."  
  
  
  A glow of satisfaction spread over Mr. Selwynson's face.


\"I am glad; tell me you are glad also, Ada; glad to
be mine, and that all may know that you are mine."  
  
  
  Ada's look and smile did not say that she was sorry.


\"You must come and speak to Aunt Jane, John.
Come and see her after we go home; we shall not stay

long."


\"I will; and Ada, next time that fat beast finds
himself in harmony with you I shall kick him."  
  
  
  " Hush, John, he is a clergyman."  
  
  
  " I don't care; I should like to kick him."


\"Why, Selwynson. What makes you so pugnacious ?
Who are you going to kick ?" said Harry Gresford,
joining them.


\"Your fat parson. He looks as if kicking would do
him good."


\"He would fall down, and all Forbes' flowers would
be shaken out of their beds. He is not such a bad sort
of chap, and knows a lot about fishing."


\"Does he; he looks as if standing still work would
suit him best."  
  
  
  Walter came up.


\"Selwynson, will you get Miss Lewisham an ice.
Francois has concocted some, and is very proud of his
achievement. Harry, go and bring your sister and Miss
Dashforth; they are in the pine walk."


The garden-party was over; night had come. The
same chestnut mare and the same rider we saw once
before were again on their way home through the
moonlit night. The rider was happy, and I think the good
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 64 -->
mare was in sympathy with the joy of her master.
John had been told of the Aix plan and had not
disapproved; he even thought he might perhaps run over
there. He hated Frenchmen—they were like poison to
him, but for once, " he shouldn't mind seeing the queer
fellows in their own country."


Miss Lewisham diffidently remarked that she thought
Aix-la-Chappelle was in Prussian territory.  
  
  
  John said :


\"Germans were not as bad as Frenchmen, but they
were such dirty-looking chaps. The German man who
taught drawing at his school appeared as if he never
washed from year's end to year's end."


After dinner, Aunt Jane watched her young friends
wandering in the garden. There was no emotion
traceable in her kind face; it was placid and undisturbed.
After watching them a minute or two, with a gentle sigh
she seated herself with her back to the light, and shut
her eyes.


During that wandering in the garden it had come to
be settled that, should nothing unforeseen occur, Mr.
Selwynson should, before Christmas acquire a wife to
reign over his hearth, his heart, and his home.


As John followed the bridle-road through Pilkington
Wood, the sweet odour of flowers called to mind his
vexation of a day or two previously at finding in Ada's
sitting-room flowers Walter Forbes had gathered in that
very wood. He smiled now at the thought of his
vexation. Walter Forbes might gather all the flowers in
the wood for her, if he liked; and if that Morgan did
talk about harmony, he was an ass, but he could not
help being as he was made.
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 65 -->

Suddenly John became aware of something moving
between the trunks of the trees, and soon a dark figure
emerged from among them into the full moonlight a
short way in front of the rider. It was a tall man; he
walked quickly on.


"A poacher," thought John; "I wonder if there are
more.—Hulloa! my man,what have you been trespassing
in that wood for ?"


The man made no reply, but continued to walk on,
soon turning from the main road into a by-path to the
right.


"Come now," shouted the squire magisterially,
putting his horse into a trot, " this won't do. What is
your name, and what brings you here ?"  
  
  
  The man veered round.


\"Nonsense, Selwynson, I am not in pursuit of your
rabbits and hares."


\"Forbes ! my dear fellow, how could I know you in
the moonlight ? You are not botanising at this time,
are you V


"No, I am taking a walk—enjoying this beautiful
night."  
  
  
  His voice was odd, hard and constrained.  
  
  
  " Nothing wrong, is there, Forbes 1"  
  
  
  " Nothing whatever, thank you. Good-night."  
  
  
  " Are not you going home ? It is past twelve o'clock."  
  
  
  " Good-night,"  
  
  
  " Good-night," and they parted.


\"Now, what on earth," pondered John, " can he be
roaming about the wood for at this time of night ?
Something is wrong with him, poor fellow."

Hood.

One sultry day towards the end of August Mrs.
Seymour and her son found themselves in Brussels en
route for Aix, or Aachen. They had travelled via the
short sea route from Dover to Calais. Mrs. Seymour
would go by no other. The Gresfords had been asked,
even pressed, to accompany them, notwithstanding
Walter's objections to a large travelling party. But
Maude was very desirous to see Antwerp Cathedral,
and Catherine wished to stop a night at Spa, where
were some of her friends.


Harry and Kate were very confident, in their power
to take care of themselves—and of Maude, who required
taking care of, as her mind was more often diving into
the past, or soaring into the future, than occupied with
the present.


The squire demurred about the young people's
independent plans, and Walter began to think Kate ought
not to be trusted solely to the care of madcap Harry.
Matters, however, were made smooth by Mrs. Seymour
placing Francois at their disposal, and they started to
go by Ostend in much gleeful excitement.  
  
  
  Miss Lewisham and Ada had gone to London some
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 67 -->
days before, as Miss Lewisham wished her niece to
purchase and prepare so many changes of raiment as
might enable her to celebrate her approaching
transition from unitism to unitedness with due and
appropriate splendour.


John intended joining them in London, and acting as
escort to Aix la Chapelle, where Walter and Mrs.
Seymour expected to find them. After her arrival in
Brussels, as Mrs. Seymour took her place at the
tabled'hote, she caught sight of a familiar face on the opposite
side of the table, some places lower down.


"There is Major Severne," she said to her son; "how
pleased I am."


Her friend at that moment sent a glance along the
row of faces in front of him; it arrested itself at
Mrs. Seymour's, and bows of recognition were
exchanged.


After the last course had gone round, and people
were moving, Major Severne made his way to our
friends, and was received by Mrs. Seymour, with the
pleasant smile, and gracious bearing, by which she could
welcome the presence of an approved, and honoured
friend.


"Major Severne, I am so delighted to see.you; this
is my son, of whom you have often heard, as he has of
you."  
  
  
  Major Severne grasped Walter's ready hand.


"When your mother and I were fellow-travellers
together, I was much interested in hearing of your
successes at Oxford. I am now very glad to make your
acquaintance."  
  
  
  " And I," said Walter, " am very pleased to be able  
  
  
  5—2
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 68 -->
to thank you, for all your aid, and kindness to my
mother, during the time you travelled together. She
has often spoken to me about it; I must ever remember
it with gratitude."


"I did but the very least the bond of Christian
fellowship entailed on me; nothing at all worthy of
gratitude. Where are you bound for, Mrs. Seymour ?
or are you making a stay in this town ?"


\"We are on our way to Aix; we expect quite a large
party of friends to meet us there. Where is your
destination ?"


\"I am glad to say it is also Aix. I have been ordered
to try the effect of the waters."


\"I am charmed; I shall like to consult you upon
several things. You will be able to interpret some
passages that are very puzzling to me. How is Mrs.
Severne ?—is she with you ?"


\"She is quite well. I regret to say she is not with
me. Our family is too numerous to move, and she
remained behind to watch over the flock while I try
the virtue of the baths at Aix as a cure for rheumatism
and acute neuralgia."


\"You are in pain now," said Walter. " Does it not
make you worse to talk ?"


\"Thank you; I fear you must excuse me, and I
must retire into solitude. I shall enjoy seeing you
presently, when my thorn in the flesh is not so acutely
troublesome; I dare say we shall travel by the same
train to Aix to-morrow."


\"Mother," said Walter, while walking with her in the
park, "as your friend is going on to-morrow, perhaps you
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 69 -->
will not mind making the journey with him, and I
shall stay on here a day or two; you wdl find the
Lewishams at Aix, and Kate and Maude will be with
you the day after to-morrow, so you will not want me."


\"I can do without you, if you fancy staying here;
but what is the attraction ?"


\"I should like to examine more closely the painted
glass in St. Gudule, and I shall perhaps go to
Waterloo."


\"Waterloo !" contemptuously repeated Mrs. Seymour.
\"What do you want to go to Waterloo for ? you will
find nothing but flatness and ugliness. I hope you
have not taken a dislike to Major Severne, Walter ?"


\"Indeed I have not; I like his face much; anyhow,
I would put up with a good deal in one who had been
so kind to you, mutterchen."


\"You conceited boy; he is a really good religious
man, and will have more to put up with in you than
you in him."


\"Perhaps it wdl be mutual putting up. I will do
my part."  
  
  
  " Do you think you could getKate—to—to" To do what ?"


\"Not to say quite all that comes into her head. I
should so like Major Severne to take to her."


\"I could not possibly interfere about Kate saying
what she likes; her sense of the fitting will prevent
her saying anything to hurt his feelings. He will not
be able to help liking her, if he is the sensible man I
take him for."


When Walter said he had taken no dislike to Major
Severne he spoke exact truth. He had long wished to
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 70 -->
meet him, to have an opportunity to observe and study
so sincere and true-hearted a specimen of the result
of Havelock's training as Major Severne presented. He
had listened to the glowing accounts his mother had
given him of the kind consideration and efficient aid
she had received from Major Severne in a time of much
need, and mingled with these accounts were relations
about the major's great piety and goodness, and somehow
Walter, while prepared to acknowledge gratefully the
debt he owed on behalf of his mother, was also
prepared to encounter a good deal that would be
antagonistic to his own taste; some self-assertive piety a habit
of searching curiously into the state of the spiritual
-well-being of others, and well-meant attempts to
advance their ghostly well-being. His preconceived ideas
of Major Severne were partly derived from the
semiclerical appearance and slightly sanctimonious
bearing of some non-episcopally-sanctioned preachers and
teachers he had from time to time come across, for he had
learnt that Major Severne was in the habit of preaching
—"casting bread upon the waters," and throwing crumbs
of comfort to be scrambled for at large gatherings.


Consequently, Mr. Walter Forbes met a pleasant
surprise when this great friend of his mother's turned
out to be very different from his expectations; and he
was introduced to a slight, tall, soldierlike-looking man,
with an oval face, fair hair, and regular features, almost
womanish in their expression of tender gentle
melancholy and delicate health, combined with something of
sensitive shyness. To this man Forbes felt an
unaccountable magnetic attraction. Nevertheless, I think
the encounter with him had something to do with Walter's
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 71 -->
desire to remain in Brussels. He felt that his. little
mother's bearing and language would insensibly change
in the presence of this influential leader of thought and
giver of tone to the set, or side, or party, or school
among which his mother and her late husband had
professed to range themselves.


Mrs. Seymour sincerely believed that her party were
\"stepping heavenward " with rather more speed than
any other party similarly engaged. She was not to be
blamed, or called a hypocrite, because she felt the
advantage of marching in such good company as that of
the Duchess of D and Countess of C, Lady
M and my Lord H., and was proud to own
as a dear personal friend one whom ladies of rank so
bowed down to and adored as they did Major Montague
Samuel Severne.


Mrs. Seymour did not inarch in the fore-front of the
vanguard of her party, but in the rearguard. There,
even, she paused a little now and then, and if the leaders
were not likely to see her, indulged in amusements they
would have deemed inconsistent and worldly.


In ordinary society she never used those turns of
expression and indefinable signs by which a vigorous
stepper is always to be recognised; but now, when
conversing with Major Severne, it was probable
significant terms would be employed rather freely, aud Walter
felt it was not in him to restrain a smile, or feel the
reverse of edified, when his mother made up her
countenance to respond to pious conversation, and he
resolved against travelling in the society of two
sympathetic steppers, considering " faith and prayers amongst
the privatest of men's affairs." Also a longing had
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 72 -->
come over him to be alone with himself, to compose his
mind, and settle his thoughts with regard to subjects
that had lately ruffled him.


Having taken his mother back to the hotel, and then
wandered musingly about for the space of an hour, he
made inquiries as to the number of Major Severne's
apartment, sought it, knocked at the door, and was
desired to enter.


\"Ah ! my young friend, are you the bearer of some
message from your mother ?"


\"No; I ventured to intrude on my own account.
You looked in such pain when we last saw you, I thought
possibly I might be of some service, and I so much
wanted to hear if you were better."


\"It was very kind of you to think about me. I am
better. You are observant, for I think and trust my
infirmity is not so palpably visible to many. In what
school did you learn to mark closely indications of
pain ?"


\"I nursed a sick friend at Oxford. He often
suffered greatly, and tried hard not to let me see how
acute his pain was; but I knew when he suffered, and
something in your face reminded me of his."  
  
  
  " Poor fellow ! Did he recover ?"


\"He never recovered," and Walter's lips trembled as
he turned aside for a moment.


"God grant that he sleeps in Jesus," said Major
Severne gravely.


Walter reverently said " Amen." Shortly afterwards
he bade good-night as a waiter entered with coffee and
biscuits.  
  
  
  " Good-night to you; we will hold converse together
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 73 -->
at Aix. I think we shall be friends;" and Major
Severne's gentle blue eyes looked searchingly and
steadfastly into Walter's.


Those blue eyes were a powerful weapon; they had
gained not a few to be the disciples of their owner.


Mrs. Seymour was afflicted from time to time with
attacks of hurriedness. At such seasons she was sorely
vexed if she had to wait for anything or any one; she
would only hurry, as if something momentous depended
upon haste. Next morning she was subject to one of
these attacks. She was in a sort of panic to leave
Brussels; she would not wait to travel till the cool of the
evening, as Major Severne meant to do, but insisted upon
flying off on the wings of the morning. She did not try
to get Walter to accompany her, but said she could very
well make the journey with her maid. So Walter went
with his mother to the station in the bas ville, and saw
her into the train. A fair was taking place in the lower
town. He wandered among the booths and tents rather
aimlessly for a while. The full flood of holiday makers
had not yet flowed in; it was too early in the morning,
and there was not much interest in the scene. So
Walter reascended the hill, and entering the church
of St. Gudule, fixed his mind and his eyes on the
examination of the painted glass in the chapel of the
Holy Sacrament. Whde so occupied, a voice behind
him said:


\"This must be the chapel which Murray says is
remarkable for the beauty of its glass."


A light came into his eyes, his face was illuminated.
Was it a tribute to the fine art work before him ? He
turned from it suddenly.

  " Ada! Miss Lewisham !—how very glad I am to see

you.  
  
  
  CHAPTER VIII.  
  
  
  'WALTER CULTIVATES FRIENDSHIP. A GHOST STORY.  
  
  
  ' Through his mind a vague self-accusation there moved;
O'er his fancy, when fancy was fairest, would rise
The infantine face of Matilda."  
  
  
  Owen Meredith.

Ada responded calmly to our friend's eager greeting,
but seemed well pleased to meet him. She explained
that her aunt and herself had come to Brussels the
night before. They had been delayed in starting by
John's having been recalled to M shire, when on
the verge of accompanying them.


The M.P. for one division of the county had died; a
contested election was expected, and Mr. Selwynson
was telegraphed for to take part in the canvass. Miss
Lewisham had delayed her journey for two days, till
the competition had really commenced, and John wrote
that it was impossible for him to leave home; there was
no likelihood that he would see Aix-la-Chapelle this
time.


\"You will let me show you Bruxelles. I may be your
cicerone this once, this one day," entreated Walter.


\"Thank you; I shall be much obliged to you. I have
never been in Brussels before. Anson is my guide;
she was here once a long time ago, but does not now
remember her way about very well. Is this the painted
glass we ought to look at ?"
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 75 -->
  
  Yes; what do you think of it ?"


\"I do not know. I suppose I ought to like it. It
would require long study to understand it properly."


\"There are some fine drawings of it extant, which you
ought to have seen first. Look at the flowing outlines
and arrangement of the figures, and you will feel how
superior it is in artistic merit to glass of any previous
date. These windows are known and celebrated
throughout the world; but there is some glass of about the
same date, not half so well known, in our own
cathedral, that is much finer. I am interested in
glass-painting, because I once dabbled in it a little. My cousin
and I built a small furnace and baked the glass we
painted."  
  
  
  " Have you been to the Grande Place ?"  
  
  
  " No; we have only just come out sight-seeing."
\"I am glad you have not seen it; let us go there.'


Anson asked if she was any longer required, or if she
should go back to her mistress. Ada was about to say
she should go back, as her mistress might be glad to
have her, when Walter, speaking hurriedly, said :


\"Oh, keep her with you. I may have to leave after
we have been to the Grande Place."  
  
  
  " I thought you were going to show me Brussels ?"


\"After all, I am not sure that I shall be able. I have
remembered an engagement for the middle of the day;
also, there is a friend of my mother's staying at my
hotel; I must see him before he leaves. He goes to
Aix to-day."


They walked round so much of the outside of the
church as they could, and paused to admire the grand
facade. Ada knew little about architecture; a sense of
<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 76 -->
a traveller's duty made her anxious to see and learn all
she could about everything, so she leant an attentive ear
to all her guide told her, and asked questions he was
pleased to be able to answer. In her heart of hearts I
think she was more interested in the good dogs drawing
their little carts, in the picturesquely dressed women in
wooden shoes, than in the painted glass and splendid
facade of St. Gudule.


With whom that has once seen it does not the Grande
Place de Bruxelles prove a pleasant memory for ever ?
The grey old Hotel de Ville with its lace-work spire aud
innumerable windows; the stern Maison du Roi, its
gloomy aspect whispering of tragedy; the
simpleminded looking Belgian flower-sellers, in costume
pleasant to an artist's eye, their faces all cast in one
mould—those of the blue blouse clad men, all cast in a
similar mould; men and women seated among piles of
flowers, and shrubs in pots.


At the time our friends saw the flower-market, the
morning freshness had not yet departed from the heaps
of carnations, sweet peas, and mignonette. Dust had
not yet gathered on the leaves of oleanders,
pomegranates, and myrtle plants.


Anson soon felt it her duty to come forward and
remonstrate upon her young lady's reckless extravagance
in the matter of flower purchases, all of which would be
dead before they, got to Aix, and there was a flower
market there, she said. So Ada desisted from procuring
yet another bunch of carnations from an old woman
who offered them as a bargain for four sous, " settlement
pour la bonne mine de madame."  
  
  
  They entered the Hotel de Ville, and studied stormy
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 77 -->
scenes in the life of King Clovis, as shown forth in
ancient tapestries.


They stood for some minutes and regarded the
frowning Broodhuis, speaking of its history; while so engaged
they were passed by Major Severne, who merely raised
his hat in recognition of Walter. Ada reminded her
guide of his engagement; said her aunt had been a long
time alone; and she must go back to her. As they
turned from the Broodhuis, Walter asked :  
  
  
  " Have you read Goethe's ' Egmont' ?"


\"Yes; it is almost the only thing of Goethe's I have
read; he says nothing about Count Horn."


\"I suppose he thought it more artistic to make
' Egmont' stand alone, and it did not suit him to
contrast their characters."


\"I remember Goethe's 'Egmont' very well, but
leannot recollect much about the real Egmont."


\"Nor do I. Goethe has blotted him out; but I believe
he was a different man from the ' Egmont' the great
author has created. I do not know that it is justifiable
to substitute fictions for historic truth, but Goethe has
himself said that ' in all artists there are seeds of
audacity '—his seeds grew and bore fruit. ' Egmont' was a
grand fellow, with his pride and loyal-hearted courage,
his love for his country, and faith in its love for
him, his inability to suspect treason in others, least of
all in his king. One of the finest touches in the
composition seems to me to be the dismay and creeping horror
he felt on finding his liberty was gone."


\"As soon as he knew he was to die, his courage
revived;" Ada remarked.  
  
  
  "Yes, he struggled with himself, and gained the mastery
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 78 -->
over dread, and then hope revived, and when Ferdinand
entered, Egmont was asleep. I have often wondered
how I ! How do you think you should feel if you
knew one day that the next you were to die ?"  
  
  
  Ada paused before she answered.


\"I think—I suppose it would make much difference
as to whether one was well, or ill, or in great pain. I
do not think I should exactly be frightened. I should
feel it was very awful. I should want to be alone and
think. Death, as death, I think I could meet calmly,
but if I knew I was to die a painful death, I fear I
might be cowardly at last."


\"It is human nature to shrink from pain"; it is
involuntary. Goethe has made Egmont sleep pleasantly
when suspense is past and he knows that he is to die.
There are many authentic instances of people sleeping
with the knowledge that they next will sleep in death,
but it always seems to me unnatural."  
  
  
  " How should you feel ?"


\"I have so often thought about it, and tried to place
myself in the same situation, that I can tell you easily
how I think I should feel if it was suddenly made
known to me that I was to die. I imagine that like
you I should feel awed, even shocked. For a little while
thought might stand still, my senses be numbed;
reaction would soon come, with it regret. I should feel
love for life strong within me, I should grieve to leave
those I care for, and be vividly impressed with the
attractions, advantages, beauties, of this lovely earth. By
degrees, as the inevitable necessity of departing forced
itself more really on my mind, I think I should begin
to speculate about the future, get excited, and—you
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 79 -->
know how impatient children are to start on a journey,
even when leaving the place and people they love V  
  
  
  Yes.


\"Well, I think I should even feel like the children,
and long to hasten to ' un jour as res mort' when I
trust to know  
  
  
  ' Pourquoi tant de combats, de larmes, de regrets,
Et tant de tristes choses.'"


This lugubrious conversation was brought to a close
by the speakers reaching the hotel in the Place Royale
where Miss Lewisham was quartered. Aunt Jane
cordially received Walter Forbes, and on learning that he
was by himself in Brussels, she warmly invited him to
drive with her that afternoon, saying it would be much
more comfortable to have a gentleman with them, who
would manage if anything went wrong: " For two ladies
to go about by themselves seems to me to be very odd,
and is not what we did in my young days; but now
people are so different."


Walter said he would come if possible. He saw
Major Severne previous to that good man's departure
for Aix.


\"Do you come on by my train ?" he asked. I have
seen nothing of your mother all day. I saw you in the
Grande Place pointing out its beauties to—I think I am
not mistaken in concluding it was to Miss Gresford—
you see I know something of your history."


Unbidden a red glow spread itself over Walter's
countenance. He explained that his mother had left
Brussels early that morning—he paused, and explained
that the young lady he was speaking to in the Place
was an acquaintance he had met by accident.
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 80 -->

"When are you coming on to Aix V Major Severne
asked, and was answered that it was uncertain. " Come
with me this evening; I own to a weakness, a dislike
to travel by myself."


\"I am sorry, but I cannot. I have an engagement
for this evening, and to-morrow I think I shall make
an expedition to Waterloo."


The drive through Brussels took place, and Walter
admirably fulfilled his office of cicerone, even ascertaining
for Ada the exact site of the house where the ball was
given from whence the Duke of Wellington and his
officers had to hurry to fight Napoleon.


\"Give me your opinion, Miss Lewisham," said
Walter; " do you think ' Vanity Fair ' or ' Childe
Harold' have done most to render that scene more
famous ?"


\"Thackeray's ' Vanity Fair '? when that book came
out, how much it was tallied about, to be sure. Becky
Sharpe—I remember Becky Sharpe very well; what a
disagreeable person she was. I did not like the book
myself, but people went mad over it. I did not
remember there was a scene laid in Brussels, but it's a
long time since I read it."


\"You remember: ' There was a scene of revelry by
night V "


\"Yes, my brother was very fond of repeating it; I
learnt it also in my young days."


\"One often sees that; it has been read at penny
readings, and it is incorporated into school
readingbooks for National Schools, which proves how popular
it is," said Ada. " I have never read ' Vanity Fair.' "  
  
  
  " Never read ' Vanity Fair '! When we go home let
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 81 -->
me lend it you. Thackeray was a great man and genius,
Byron's verses have been, are, and ever will be very
popular."  
  
  
  " You mean to disparage Byron."


\"No; he had great power, and therefore great
influence. Thackeray helps us to see clearly the horror
of falsity and sin, while Byron veils them so cunningly,
they appear grand aud attractive.—This is the column
of the constitution, that figure on the top is Leopold I.
Do you care for pictures ? If so, we had better now
drive to the Palais des Beaux Arts, but I do not
promise you a great treat. My advice is to leave them
alone."  
  
  
  " What would you like, my dear ?" said Aunt Jane.


\"I have seen as much as I can remember, and do
not care to see any more. Let us drive home now."


They drove back to the hotel. It was settled that
Walter should escort Ada and Anson to walk in the
park that evening. Aunt Jane regarded the plan with
some slight discomfort. When Walter was gone, she
said, hesitatingly:


\"I hope my dear, John would not dislike your going,
because to my old-fashioned ideas it does seem a little
odd to walk about so late in the evening with young
Forbes, who is no relation to you, though he is a nice
fellow, but I know people do all sorts of outrageous
things abroad without transgressing etiquette."


Ada declared John would have no sort of objection to
her going into the park.


Unselfish Aunt Jane said not a word respecting her
own dislike to be left in a strange hotel by herself.
Faithful Anson did demur a little about leaving her,  
  
  
  G
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 82 -->
being well aware how nervous her mistress would get
in her absence; but she liked going out too well, to
raise many objections to so pleasant a plan.


So when the cool of the evening came, Ada, Anson
and Walter were walking in the pleasant avenues of the
Pare de Bruxelles; it grew dusk, stars came out, and
the trio were still there. Walter and Ada had pitied
the poor pollard acacias, bounding the recreation ground,
watched the good Belgians recreating themselves,
speculated on their relationships and occupations, touched
on some details of the morning's conversation, falling
into those pleasant restful silences and pauses which
are adjuncts of the evening time.


Anson, who missed no opportunity of burnishing her
rather rusty French, was talking to a fat conversational
Belgian woman by whom she was seated.


Ada and Walter were occupying a neighbouring seat.
Suddenly, from an alley behind them, there glided into
the moonlight a white-clad figure, and passed into the
main walk. Ada started as it passed her; no sound of
footsteps had given warning of its approach.  
  
  
  " You believe in ghosts," said Walter.


\"I am afraid you will think me very foolish if I say
I do to a certain extent. I have heard ghost stories
that are well authenticated, and do not you think most
people have at times a consciousness that spirits watch
them or are present ?"


\"Popular consciousness has little to do with truth;
when people believe in a thing they are conscious of it.
All of us that believe in fiction are conscious it is fact,
till scales fall from our eyes and we are convinced and
equally conscious it is fiction. But who at this hour
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 83 -->
would have anything to say against ghosts. I am open
to conviction; tell me a ghost story and convince me!"


\"We must go back; Anson has talked out all her
French. Your mother is a much more confirmed
believer in ghosts than I am. If she has not yet
convinced you, I shall also fail."


He answered, "I think you could convince me of
most things. I think I could follow where you lead."


\"I have no intention of leading you among ghosts; I
would rather not have much to do with them. Anson,
Mr. Forbes wants to hear a ghost story; come and tell
us yours."


Anson came. And as they went towards the hotel,
gladly began her relation, which she was fond of telling.
She had somehow picked up a fair education; at one
time she had learnt dressmaking in Paris, where she had
acquired her French. She had travelled with a former
mistress, who had treated her—deservedly—as a
confidential servant, as did Miss Lewisham, with whom she
had now been some years. Anson's manners and
language were superior to most of her class; she never
stepped out of her position, or encroached upon her
mistress's favour.


\"My story, sir, is a very simple story, as you may
say. Apparitions have sometimes appeared to give
direct warnings or information. Sometimes they seem
to have been sent to reveal some secret that has
longbeen hidden, or to predict something that is to happen.
I do not think they ever come for nothing. I hope, sir,
Miss Ada has not made you think that my ghost is a
very wonderful ghost ?"  
  
  
  No; Miss Ada has in no way raised my expectations.  
  
  
  6—2
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 84 -->
You are evidently an authority upon the subject of
ghosts. Please, Mrs. Anson, to begin."


\"When I was a child and lived with my mother in
Lincoln's Inn Fields, she did not let me play with all the
neighbours' children, but there were two, a boy and a
girl, with whom I was allowed to associate; we three
were great friends; in fact, we were hardly ever apart.


\"When I was about nine years old, scarlet fever was
for a while prevalent in our vicinity. My little friend,
Anne Mason, sickened for it. I and the boy, Robert
Jackson, also caught the complaint soon afterwards; he
had it very badly. One day, when I was getting better,
I was sitting up in bed at about half-past twelve in the
day. Mother was cooking in the kitchen; the door of
my room was standing half open, when I saw Robert
Jackson come through it; he had on the same jacket
and trousers I had last seen him in, his face was pale,
he did not speak, but stood near the wall and looked
fixedly at me. I looked at him; he stayed about five
minutes, we neither of us spoke. He then passed
noiselessly out, once turning his head to look at me again.
When my mother came up, I told her what I had seen.
She said, ' Then he is dead.' We soon learnt that it was
so; he had expired about the time I saw him. My
mother would not talk or let me talk about the
circumstance for some time, but she afterwards told Anne
Mason's mother, who said that about half-past twelve
o'clock that same day her little girl woke up out of
sleep, and said, ' Mother, I have seen Bobby; he was
dead,' and directly afterwards a messenger had come
saying that the boy was dead."  
  
  
  " Thank you for the story," said Walter, after a short
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 85 -->
silence. "May I ask were you frightened when you
saw the ghost ?"  
  
  
  " I have no recollection of feeling any fear."


\"I should like to ask you more about it another
time; here is your hotel, and I must not keep you now."
He whispered to Ada, " Thank you for a happy day;
henceforth the city and park of Brussels will be very
dear to me. Good-night, good-bye."  
  
  
  CHAPTER IX.

NATURE CHEERS A TROUBLED MIND.—MORE FRIENDS
APPEAR.—REFLECTIONS.—WALTER AND KATE AT SPA.

\"But thence to gain the upper air and win the footstep back,
This is lue Ueed, this is the toil."
Moekis : Æneid of Virgil.

Very early the following day, before the greater part of
the good people of Brussels were astir or awake, a tall
slight man might have been seen walking with long
quick steps along the dusty road leading to Waterloo.
The road was dusty, but the pedestrian could have
chosen no pleasanter time for his walk. Brussels was
asleep, but the country was awake; sunshine and cloud
shadows fell alternately athwart the flat plots of
cultivation. Here and there, by the sides of the road, were
cherry trees, some few still loaded with brilliant,
glistening fruit. The flax harvest was over, piles of flax
were left standing in rows down the fields to season.
The loud voice of chanticleer might often be heard
from some little homestead. Men in blue blouses led
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 86 -->
up sleepy-looking white horses from pasture. Carts
laden with vegetables and flowers wound on their way
towards the city. Women in white head-gear and
clattering sabots bore baskets of flowers townwards.
Cows mooed, impatient to be milked, standing together
in pretty groups; sometimes one of the group was being
milked by a strong, happy-looking peasant girl. On the
brown backs of the cattle the morning light fell in
marked ridges, a pleasant study of warm colour to an
artist's eye, one that Belgian and Dutch artists have
appreciated. Many such a morning must Paul Potter
have wandered abroad with his pencil.


When the man left the town, an observer might have
thought him a stern, rather melancholy man. His lips
were somewhat compressed, his expression gloomy; he
took no notice of external objects, seeming to be
occupied with his own thoughts, and with rapidly
hurrying from the town of Brussels.


After a while, as he got into the country, he looked
around frequently, and the close-shut lips relaxed their
fixedness.


Before he had reached the Foret de Soignies, or rather,
the groups of trees that had once formed part of the
great forest, there was light in his eye and exultation
in his bearing. Mother Nature had spoken strong
cheering words in an ear that could listen to her
consolation, and smiled upon a son that could see the
sweetness of her smile. After walking several miles, he
threw himself down under a tree.


"Now will I think this matter out," said the way
farer to himself. " I will look in the face this delusion,
hallucination, fancy, foolishness; how nearly I proved
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 87 -->
myself an utter fool. ' Plus fort que moi,' I said all the
night long. ' Plus fort que moi,' I will fly from the
battle-field. I thought I would go anywhere, writing
to my mother not to expect me at Aix. Now I feel
bolder and better. Earth, sky, and light, thank you—
thank you for your restorative. I shall not fly my
ground. I will go—I will conquer; surely that sunny
face and golden hair will cure this madness. Man can
be stronger than his will. I must hold the helm and
steer my course; wishes, delusions, will, you shall know
your master—and yet—and yet.  
  
  
  " ' To tunes we did not call our being must keep chime.'

Perhaps I did call the music, and listened and
listened till I could hear no other. Well, I am now on
my guard. My mother, all of them expect me, and will
think it odd if I do not go; my little mother will talk
and wonder and speculate more than any of the rest. I
must go to Aix. It is settled."


And Walter Forbes, for the traveller was he, gave
himself up to contemplate the effects of light and shade
as he continued his journey. He met a flower-seller on
her way to La Grande Palace. She walked six mdes
night and morning to find purchasers for her roses and
carnations. He stopped her, bought a bunch of
carnations, selected two, and replaced the others in her basket.
He began to think breakfast would be a pleasant
termination to his walk, but it was not for another hour
and a half that he gained the village of Waterloo, and
could regale himself on hot coffee and omelets at the
vdlage inn, reading a three days' old Times the while.
Then viewed the scene of British glory, with difficulty
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 88 -->
withstanding the clamours of relic vendors and guides.
An inundation of tourists arrived, among them a little
English clergyman, with a lady taller than himself on
his arm. Walter looked at him and exclaimed :


\"Ha! Grant, who would have thought of meeting
you here !"


\"Forbes ! is it really you ? My dear fellow, I am
glad to see you. Let me introduce you to Mrs. Grant."  
  
  
  The tall lady cordially held out her hand.


\"Your name is not unknown to me, Mr. Forbes.
Jonathan has often spoken to me of you, and said how
you read together at Harrow and Oxford; excuse me, I
must select one of those charming relics as an
association of this interesting place."


\"Well, Grant, what are you doing 1" said Walter, as
the lady began eagerly to examine the so-called relics
offered to her. " First of all, I must congratulate you,.
old fellow. Why do you never write to me ?"


\"I might say the same, Forbes. I did not know your
direction after you left Cumberland. You must come
and see us; my wife will be glad to receive you. She
writes beautiful poetry; you and she will get on well
together. She takes such an interest in all these
famous sort of places. I have doubts as to whether all
the things they sell could really have been picked up
after the battle. She says I have no appreciation of
character, if I think these simple-minded people would
deceive like Jewish pedlars. Well, my love, what have
you got 1"


\"Oh dear ! Jonathan, I have succeeded in obtaining a
spur, a real spur covered with rust. You can have no
wicked doubts about its having been used in the great
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 89 -->
battle. My husband seemed to think that these things
they sell could not all have been picked up on the field
of carnage; but I say truth and honour is written
on the seller's countenances. You agree with me, do
you not, Mr. Forbes ?"


\"I quite agree with you in liking the Belgian people;
they are very industrious, also very obliging and
wishful to supply the wants of strangers. I think it will
be long before they fad to find these relics—not while
demand proves how many agree with you in valuing
them."


Mrs. Grant looked at Walter, and seeing no trace of
a smile on his grave face, said :


\"Yes, they will dig and look for these mementoes of
the past more diligently. You see, Johnny dear, Mr.
Forbes agrees with me."


\"Does he ?" said Johnny. " Come, my dear, I have
engaged a guide, and Murray says it will take a good
while to see it all. Forbes, do not forget to look us up
at Radon Rectory. I have long kept some good wine
for you, oh, Mæcenus ! Do not let the ' sloping fields of
Æsula, or the hills of Telegonus,' withhold you from
coming to drink it."


\"Do not fail us, Mr. Forbes,," added the lady. "
Intellectual society is such a treat to Johnny. He has
no kindred spirit at Radon."


\"I feel sure Grant will never again feel the need of a
kindred spirit, or want more intellectual society than
he possesses."


Shortly after this interview, Walter Forbes began to
retrace his steps towards Brussels, but soon paused
beneath some trees, took a book from his pocket and
<!-- Leaf 98 -->
■90  
  
  
  WALTER FORBES.

reposed. He lay down his book and reflected in a
disjointed, rambling way.


"Very incomprehensible," he thought," is the propensity
we human creatures have to make pilgrimages. Crowds
will flock to see a bare room with a blood-stain on the
floor, a spring- of water a saint has bathed in, a saintly
bone, a place where men were once led on to destroy
each other and that once ran red with gore—anything,
everything that crime or virtue, courage or tradition,
have rendered famous. To tread the very ground, and see
the very scene of action is not enough for all; they must
-carry away something for a recollection that they can
feel and touch. These portions of matter have to be
provided; who can blame the Belgians for providing
what the British eagerly demand ? If twenty battles
had been fought, pillagers would hardly have obtained
the amount of ' relics ' that have been sold—that good
John Bull, labouring under ' that disadvantage of
honest hearts, credulity,' exchanges his franc for. Is
there any bound to the credulity of men ? truly, I think
there is not.


\"A sick child dozes, and dreams of her constant
playmate, and thinks she has seen a ghost, which idea is
fostered by parents and friends merely upon the ground
of the child's tale, and the coincidence of the subject of
the dream having died at the time the dreamer dreamt.
The child becomes a woman, and a sensible woman, but
still retains the impressions of childhood, and seeks for
no other solution of the ' vision' than a supernatural
one. It is an easy, convenient way of accounting for
a puzzling circumstance or labyrinthine difficulty, and
has served men throughout time for the solving of many
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 91 -->
an otherwise brain-torturing problem; and then our
active imagination will not let any conceivable place be
void—the region beyond knowledge we people with
creatures of our fancy, and look at them so long and
lovingly that we teach ourselves to take fancy for fact.


"But woe be to the unlucky wight who, finding these
fancies are not facts, begins unwarily to proclaim his
discovery to the multitude; he who sets hastdy to work
to expunge the pre-conceived notions of the populace,
will soon feel the pelting of a hail-storm about his ears,
and however clearly he may prove error to be error, if
he cannot replace the false with the true, what has he
done ? He has taken away the children's bread and
offered them stones. Brothers, what have I to offer
you ? The end of knowledge, the end of wisdom—  
  
  
  ' Is but to know how little can be known,
To see all other's faults and own one's own.'"


When the heat of the day had passed, our friend
arose and walked on, reaching Brussels at nightfall.
Early next morning he went to Spa, where he found
the Gresfords. They meant to go that evening to Aix,
but Walter persuaded them to reconsider their
intention, and promised to go there with them the next day.
Ponies were procured, and he and Kate went for a long
ride in the woods.


"Walter, you have grown thinner than ever," said
Kate, " and there are lines round your eyes. Have you
been studying ' Le Moyen Age,' because it has made
me quite ill. Do not you notice my altered appearance ?
and Maude has been so excited she has not been able to
eat."
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 92 -->

\"You wanted me, to keep you from having an
unmerciful dose of ' Le Moyen Age,' and I have wanted you.
I have been ill; j'ou must make me well."


Kate came closer and laid her hand on his; some
mist came across his eyes. Dropping the rein on the
quiet pony's neck, he took her hand in both of his.

\"Let us have a canter," he said, resuming the rein;
\"then tell me all you did at Antwerp, and how you got
so tired of the ' Middle Ages.'"  
  
  
  When they pulled in the horses, Catherine began :


\"At Antwerp, Maude and all of us wanted to see the
cathedral, and it was very fine, and the spire very
pretty; but Maude stayed there so long, and would talk
' Moyen Age' to me and Harry till he got cross and
said he hated the word. Then she found another church,
and then we went to the picture gallery, and Maude
said we should see Rubens in perfection. I looked at
his chair, I did not care for his pictures; there was a
picture of some rather jolly swans fighting, and a few
other things I liked. Harry got very tired and wanted
to walk by the river; but we could not get Maude away.
You will think me very silly, but Harry and I found a
quiet seat, and played at cat's-cradle with some string I
found in my pocket."  
  
  
  " What did you do afterwards ?"


\"Maud went to some more churches with Francois.
Harry and I walked by the river; we sat down by it for
some time, and threw ducks and drakes. I know you
think us great donkeys."


\"I think you were great babies. I don't want you to
pretend to care about art more than you really care for
it. To really care for the works of the old masters, and
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 93 -->
admire the composition of Rubens, requires more culture
and training than I think you possess. As we were saying
the other day, people pretend to care for art much more
than they do, but I do not want my Katie to pretend.
However, I think it would be better not to play at
cat'scradle in a public gallery another time."


Walter had no sooner spoken than he felt vexed with
himself. He wondered what possessed him to speak to
Kate in that fatherly tone; usually Kate would have
slightly resented it, but now some vein of sadness in
her lover's tone aud manner touched, subdued, and even
made her a little sad.


That evening there was a fete in the woods not far
from Spa; our friends drove to the spot. The trees
were illuminated with coloured lanterns, long lines of
light stretched from tree to tree. Booths, displaying all
sorts of wares, abounded.


While stopping to watch the peasants waltzing
on a boarded space prepared for the purpose, Kate
remarked :


"How well these people dance. English peasants
look ludicrous waltzing; they would knock against each
other perpetually in so crowded a space."  
  
  
  Walter answered:


\"Dancing is an art the English labourer certainly does
not excel in; but he does not practise it or take pride in
skilful performance, as these peasants do. Some of
those fellows who are guiding their partners so cleverly
are probably known as famous dancers at all fairs and
fetes for miles round."


"English people would not be so orderly and well
behaved. Look how crowded it is everywhere, yet they
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 94 -->
do not push and shout, although they laugh and talk
merrily," said Maude.


\"If Englishmen would refrain from imbibing so much
intoxicating beverage, I do believe fairs and rejoicings
in England might be as orderly as they are here."  
  
  
  Quoth Harry:


\"Lots of chaps don't care much about fairs or
rejoicings unless they can get drunk. When Jack Hamilton
came of age, Thomas Bruce, the farmer, said he should
make merry every day for a week; he kept his word,
and was very merry. His wife only laughed about it,
and thought it a great joke; he is a steady fellow enough
usually."


\"Why are not there laws to prevent people being so
horrid ?" said Kate.


\"There are general laws which act to a certain
extent, but till public opinion condemns the habit in all
classes much more strongly than it does at present, I
fear legislation will not find a preventative. Society in
general has to answer for most offences, more than the'
individual offenders. When society, in all its strata,
combine to make a firm law, though the penalty for
transgression be nothing more than to incur the
displeasure of all society, the cases of infringement will be
diminished."


No one spoke for a few instants. Then said Kate,
thoughtfully :


\"I have been trying very hard to understand what
that means; it sounds very wise, but might you not as
well say that when nearly everybody is good there will
not be many bad people, because everybody makes
society."
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 95 -->
  
  Walter laughed.


\"Well done, Kate! There is nothing like
straightforward common sense; but I mean that when every
one thinks good, they will support many in being good.
However, you have closed my mouth, and we will talk
ethics another time, and look at this magic-lantern
now."


At the end of a long vista of trees, dissolving views
were to be seen, and our party stayed some time looking
at them.


A lady sat near them, also looking at the magic
pictures. An old woman came up, collecting sous for the
hire of chairs. She demanded payment from the lady,
who felt for her purse, but had not got it. An officer
in uniform came forward, and said angrily to the
woman, " C'est la Reine'" The standers-by caught and
echoed the words, shouts of " Vive la Reine!" arose,
people in the distance heard aud revived the cheers,
the wood resounded to cries which rose and fell and rose

again.


Then our friends went to the stalls and spent much
time in chosing fairings for each other. They
unanimously voted it would be far pleasanter to walk, than to
drive back to Spa.


Walter gave up Kate to Harry, bargaining that they
should keep close, and then let Maude talk "Moyen
Age " to her heart's content.

  CHAPTER X.

A COMMITTEE SIT UPON ADA.—ARRIVAL OF TRAVELLERS.—
THE OCCUPATIONS OF AIX.

\"Quaint old town of toil and traffic, quaint old town of art

and song,

Memories haunt thy pointed gables like the rooks that round

them throng."
Longfellow.

Mrs. Seymour and Major Severne were seated on a
bench outside of their hotel at Aix. The day had been
hot and sultry; now, at six o'clock in the evening, the
air was still heavy, and no leaf was stirring.
Nevertheless, the good city was astir, people were departing
or arriving, the rumble of carriage wheels was incessant,
while an unbroken succession of foot-passengers passed
up and down either on the pavement or on the broad walk,
with trees on each side, that passed down the centre of the
boulevard in which the hotel was placed. Miss Lewisham
and Ada had also been sitting outside of the hotel,
rather to the elder lady's horror : for ladies to sit out in
the public streets seemed to her very odd, so very unlike
English notions. She and Ada had just left our other
friends, and were taking a promenade down the avenue.


\"Your friend, Ada Lewisham, interests me strongly,"
said Major Severne. " I feel sure there is depth in her
character; I think she is impressionable also. Tell me
something about her home life ? what leadings and
influences surround her ?"


\"At present she lives with her aunt. She did live
with a clergyman brother till he married; his influence
could hardly be for good, as I hear he is one of those
who lay much stress on the efficacy of works, but I
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 97 -->
know him but slightly. Ada is engaged to a young
neighbour of ours, a very nice, steady fellow, John
Selwynson; it will be a great match for her."


"Engaged to John Selwynson, is she! I knew his
father. Is it likely to prove a satisfactory marriage—
will they mutually influence each other for good ?"


\"I believe they were brought up almost as brother and
sister, and are much attached to each other. Mr.
Selwynson is respected and liked as a good landlord and
magistrate; he is not very clever, perhaps. I do not
suppose he has thought seriously yet. Ada is a religious,
good girl, and may lead him, though she has been
taught to hold with those who wander after things of
men's imagining, instead of keeping to gospel truth."


\"I suppose Mr. Selwynson is rich; do you think that
influenced Miss Lewisham in accepting him ?"


\"No, I really do not think it did. I was told she had
had two good offers previously to his. He is an ardent
lover; you cannot be in the room with them two
minutes without finding that out. She is calm and
quiet, and does not show her feelings at all in pubbc."  
  
  
  " But you think she cares for him ?"


\"Oh, yes; I am sure she is very fond of him, and it
is such a good match for her. I believe she is quite
dependent on her aunt and brother."  
  
  
  Major Severne sighed.


\"Now we are on the subject of marriages, let me ask
when your son's is to take place ?"


\"It is not settled yet. Here are some new arrivals
for our hotel. Is it ?—yes, it is Francois on the box.
I do believe it is the Gresfords."  
  
  
  A carriage drew up, Maude and Catherine got out of  
  
  
  7
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 98 -->
it; at the same moment Miss Lewisham and Ada came
up after their walk. Eager greetings and welcomes
followed.


\"What have you done with Harry ?" said Mrs.
Seymour.


Maude explained that Harry and Walter had remained
at the Bahnhof to get out the registered luggage, and
pass it through the custom-house.


\"Walter!" his mother exclaimed. " Oh, how glad I
am he has come. I could not think what he could find
to do at Brussels all this time."  
  
  
  " He came to Spa yesterday morning," said Maude.


Then Walter, Harry and the luggage arrived; rooms
were looked at, supper ordered, and except Major
Severne, the whole of our friends adjourned to the
breakfast-room, where the travellers' refreshment was
brought. The fire of questions and answers became fast
and furious, and every one related their various
adventures and experiences, comparing them with their friends'.
At length, sleepy waiters looked in so anxiously and
sooften, the party broke up.


Catherine and Maude were located in a large room up
several flights of stairs, looking to the front of the hotel;
they were awakened from slumber very early next
morning by the clang of many bells from many
belfries; opposite to them, beyond a belt of green leafage,
rose the lofty apse of Charlemagne's cathedral; near it
an old church tower, and two curious round towers or
spires, rather like turned pianoforte legs placed
wrongside upwards. Maude exclaimed rapturously at the sight
of the cathedral. Kate was a little incredulous about
the old building opposite being the cathedral, it was
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 99 -->
sosmall. However, Maud held to her opinion, and said
she could not be mistaken, because she had seen prints
representing it. Before the girls had quite finished
their toilet, a knock was heard at the door: " Herein,"
said Maud.


\"Hie in!" quoth Harry, as he entered; " that's a
queer way of answering. Look here, Maude, you must
put a decent gown on. I won't walk about with you
in that dirty old thing you have worn ever since we left
home."


\"Oh, Harry ! what does it signify for an old woman
like me ? I am in such a hurry to see the cathedral."  
  
  
  " Well, you can see the cathedral from my window.  
  
  
  I win show it you as soon as you have changed your

gown."


"Much obliged to you, Mr. Harry," said Kate, "but
we can see it very well from our own window; look
there!"


\"That is not the cathedral," said Harry scornfully.
\"There is a much finer building to be seen from my
window, which looks out the other way. My cathedral
is twice as large as that old church."


\"That is the cathedral," replied Maude; " but I should
like to see your fine sham one."


Kate had by this time unpacked Maude's box and
found her a gown which Harry consented to approve of.
The girls then accompanied him to his quarters, from
whence he triumphantly pointed out a huge red-brick
building. It was the hospital.  
  
  
  Maude merely looked at him speechlessly.  
  
  
  Kate laughed, and said:  
  
  
  " Well done, Harry ! even I should have known better  
  
  
  7—2
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 100 -->
than that; I knew the cathedral was old, because it had
something to do with Charlemagne. That place must
be a convent or monastery. Let us go out and see
what we can see."


The proposition was agreed to. Although it was
still early, a band was playing, and they saw numbers
of people bearing cups and glasses all hastening to the
same point. They followed in the stream of the people
to the gates opposite to the hotel, which opened into a
garden. The old man at the gates politely invited them
to enter, but advised them to subscribe for the entrie of
the gardens. In the garden they found Mrs. Seymour
and Major Severne, who had been drinking water
from the Elisen-brunnen. Major Severne was
introduced.


"You are early risers after your journey," he said.
"I presume you have no intention of drinking the
water, and that a spirit of inquiry has led you here ?
Let me counsel you to go on into the market; if you
will let me, I will show you the way; the flowers and
fruit are now fresh."


Kate, to whom he addressed himself, gave a slightly
ungracious assent. She had caught sight of a bundle
of tracts that stuck out of his pocket, while in his hand
he carried a small red testament, out of which he
seemed to be reading to Mrs. Seymour as the others
came up.


Kate made up her mind she should not hke him.

The market was crowded; the sellers were driving a
lively trade. Old women, seated before their vegetables
and flowers, were energetically wrangling about price
with thrifty German housewives and citizens; groups
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 101 -->
stood with their heads close together, gossiping; others
talked loudly to each other from stall to stall; here
and there two vendors might be seen engaged in
vehement dispute, their voices rising in shrill angry
tones, every action and expression denoting scorn,
wrath, and indignation. Before the grey old
Rathhaus, with its comical towers, was spread the lively,
many-coloured picture; in its face rose the hum and
buzz of mingled sound. It had witnessed such scenes
for many years, and its windows had the air of ignoring
the present, while they gazed dreamily into the future
till it became the past. Near to it an oddly dressed
fireman walked up and down, looking as if he also was
a remnant of " Le Moyen Age."


Major Severne talked to many of the peasants; he
spoke German fluently, but was not always able to
understand the kind of patois in which they answered.
None of the Gresfords had much knowledge of German;
none of them were competent to follow the conversation.
To those peasants who seemed most intelligent, Major
Severne gave a tract or leaflet of English authorship,
translated into German.


Having seen enough of the market, our friends
retraced their footsteps down the steep, narrow street
leading from the market-place to the botanical gardens.
Maude petitioned for one glance into the interior of the  
  
  
  cathedral, so all the party entered it; Catherine and
Harry exclaimed under their breaths at its dirty,
ddapidated appearance; one portion was undergoing
repair, which was partly the cause of the confusion,  
  
  
  dust, and dirt reigning in the rest of the building.  
  
  
  Many peasants were kneeling there, telling their
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 102 -->
beads with much apparent devotion. Maude would
fain have lingered, marking the various fine effects of
light through the open doorways, and watching the
attitudes of the praying people. The Roman Catholic
churches had begun to possess for her much attractive
charm; had she been alone, she too would have knelt to

pray.


Kate and Harry after a few minutes took her arms
and forcibly ejected her from the cathedral, Kate
promising to accompany her there again later in the
day.


They returned through the garden, which was almost
deserted, the band having ceased playing.


During breakfast, at which meal all our friends met,
Kate gave such a glowing account of "the beautiful
old women" in the market, Ada became desirous of
trying to sketch them, and asked Kate if she would do
so also, which she agreed to.


Harry said he was going to walk up the mountain,
and rather wished Walter to accompany him. Walter
demanded to know where the mountain was, when
it appeared that Harry thought the Louisberg he had
heard of was a mountain, and would, perhaps, have
snow on its summit. He was rather proud of his
knowledge of German, and much disappointed at being
undeceived about the snow, and also by finding no one
would walk far with him in the heat of the day.


Walter rambled about the town with him for an
hour, and then retired to his room to write and
study. He came down late to dinner, and found
a place reserved for him between Ada and Major
Severne.
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 103 -->

\"How did your sketching prosper, Miss Lewisham ?"
asked Walter, as he took his seat.


\"Not very well. I cannot sketch quickly. A crowd
of children just let out of school came round us. In
respect of crowding and staring, German children are
no better than English ones."


"I do not think German things are better in any
respect. Have you fallen into the delusion of thinking
all foreign things better than English ones ?"


"Certainly not, so far as I have seen; but my
experience of foreign things is very limited. I did not
give you credit for being such a John Bull as to think
all English things best."


"You mistook my meaning. I did not express to
you my contempt of foreign things; I asked if you had
fallen into the delusion of preferring foreign things to
English things; a typical John Bull passes through
other countries than his own, despising the natives,
their manners and customs, but a typical Mrs. or Miss
John Bull, after her first continental tour, holds the
ways of her own country in sovereign contempt, and
considers foreign customs extremely superior."


Forbes spoke irritably, and with heat quite unsuited
to the subject.  
  
  
  Ada replied to his manner rather than to his words.


\"Do not quarrel with me," she said softly. A sense
of the ludicrous struck her; she smiled. " The heat of
this place has made you cross. It is too absurd to
dispute as to whether you or I are most like a John
Bull. Why are you so anxious to fix upon me the
imputation ?"  
  
  
  " I am cross no longer; forgive me," he murmured.
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 104 -->

\"Forbes, what are your plans for this afternoon," said
Major Severne, rather emphatically.


Walter turned to him; plans were discussed, all the
party joining in the discussion.


It was settled that they would aU go up the
Louisberg; the men and Kate Gresford were to walk, Mrs.
Seymour, Miss Lewisham, Maud and Ada were to
drive.


A pedestrian party of four people always breaks into
halves; our party proved no exception.


Walter took possession of Kate. Harry, rather to
his dismay, found himself tete-a-tete with Major
Severne. The boy cast wistful and entreating glances at
his sister; she would not see them, so he silently steeled
himself to bear his fate with fortitude, expecting to hear
an instructive and admonitory discourse, "or jaw of
some kind," he said to himself.


Major Severne began to talk to him, asking questions
about his school life, to which Harry returned short
and shy answers, but presently thawed on discovering
that his companion was also a Eugbean, and really
interested in hearing of the changes' that had taken place
since his own schoolboy days. Before the summit of
the Louisberg was nearly reached, the pair had
exchanged reminiscences of sundry escapades; indeed, it
appeared as if the pious major had been that kind of
boy specifically denominated " awful pickle." Of course,
he warned Harry not to follow his example, and said
how much he regretted the foolish things he had then
done; but the note of admiration depicted in Harry's
countenance did not admit of much doubt being
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 105 -->
entertained that example rather than precept would be
followed.


Major Severne liked fresh young nature. He
generally won the hearts of the young, for it is the
impulse of youth to respond to sympathy, and Major
Severne's sympathetic temperament often gained him
love. He could listen with such full true interest to
genuine narrative, wliile his penetration was seldom at
fault in detecting the true from the false. His nature
was naturally sympathetic, and he had carefully and
with long and painful training made it more so, and
had set himself to eradicate selfishness, and to feel for
others more than for himself.


The careless schoolboy felt the charm of this
responsive nature. How little did any thought cross
his mind, that the fine instrument he touched on had
been tuned with great care and labour to bring forth
true notes of melody, harmonising with the songs of
many singers, singing many kinds of songs.


From histories of schoolboy pranks the conversation
passed to other more serious topics; once Catherine,
looking back, saw her brother with a graver expression
on his face than she had ever seen there before; he was
evidently listening earnestly to the words of the older
man—a disciple was listening to a master.


Major Severne had touched upon a subject he seldom
cared to speak of, the Indian Mutiny; he ended by
saying:


"When I saw the fearful unrestrained passions of
the heathens, contrasted with the noble, cool, high
daring of some of our fellows, particularly those who
had been taught by their general to fight for Christ as
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 106 -->
well as for their country, I tried more than I had ever
done before to follow where my general led; I was
convinced that nothing but the faith of Christ
can save men from themselves, support them in
trial here, and prepare them for life everlasting.
I resolved to win souls for Christ whenever and
wherever I could. I resolved never to be ashamed to
show under whose banner I served. I have not always
kept my resolutions. I am often inclined to keep my
lips shut for fear of being ridiculed, but you, my boy,
though my ways seem strange to you, you will not put
stumbling-blocks in my path, will you, nor in that of
others who are trying to serve the Lord ?"  
  
  
  Harry turned very red and muttered " No."


\"I shall pray that you also may one day be utterly
convinced of the need of Christ; till then, bear with
me, and God guide you, my boy."


They kept silence for awhile, and shortly afterwards
joined the others.


In the meantime Walter and Kate had not held
much conversation. After making a few rather
commonplace observations, Forbes had fallen into a fit of
moody abstraction. It was unlike himself to do so,
and the lady, having failed to awaken him, began to
feel slightly ill-used, and would have called Harry to
her side, and left her lover to pursue his own reflections,
had he not presently answered some little remark of
hers in a tone expressive of so much suppressed pain
that she exclaimed:


\"Walter, you are ill, or something is the matter; tell
me, dearest."
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 107 -->

The " dearest" was a strange word in her mouth; and
Walter's smile and glance thanked her for it.


"No, Katie," he said, "I am not ill. No one has
vexed me, but I have vexed and am vexing myself."  
  
  
  "Why?"


"Because I cannot succeed in resisting external
force. The world is made of agents and patients—those
who are acted upon, and those who are acting upon
others. I am at present a patient. I cannot break
away. I have despised other patients—now I must
despise myself."


\"You are trying to puzzle me. I would rather you
said, in plain words, that you do not want to tell me
what is the matter."


\"My child, I cannot tell you now. I think the time
may come when we may smile together over my
present folly and weakness. You give me strength

when you caU me that sweet name; let me hear it
again."  
  
  
  " No, not again; it is your turn, Walter."


\"My turn." And the word half formed itself on his
lips; he faltered and paused. "You know how dear
you are to me. We trust each other, do we not ?"  
  
  
  " Yes," said Kate, " but "


At this moment the carriage overtook them, and
stopped for Maud and Mrs. Seymour to get out, and
Catherine to get in.


Ada said she would remain in the carriage till Harry
and Major Severne, who were now in advance, were
overtaken, when Major Severne could have her seat if
he would.  
  
  
  At the top of the hill all met, but Walter soon
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 108 -->
detached himself from the others, and returned back by
the same way.  
  
  
  CHAPTER XL  
  
  
  A DEVOTIONAL DEMONSTRATION.—THE THOUGHTS IT
GAVE RISE TO.


\"But the law to which he would compel obedience was not a
rigid code of regulations; it was a law which recognised the
free aspirations of the human spirit, which admitted that the
manifestations of each age, if they are true and spring from
deep life, must move on different lines from the manifestations
of all other ages. Hence, his sympathy was large enough to
acknowledge excellence in many forms; he could detect the
inward harmony of many variations on the same theme."—Life
of Lessing.

The next day was the Sabbath day, and that Sabbath
day was a high day.


A great procession was to walk round the town,
priests upholding consecrated elements to the gaze of
the multitude.


Maude and Ada went to hear mass at the old church
opposite to the cathedral. As they walked there Maud
said:


"See, all the shop windows are prepared for the
occasion, and have figures of saints, and candles
placed ready to light in them. How anxious these
people are to honour their faith."


\"Do you think they are sincere, or that they only put
on a show of great devotion under the influence of the
priests?" asked Ada.


\"Oh! there can be no doubt they are sincere. Look
at their faces as they come from their work, and
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 109 -->
occupations, and kneel to pray in the churches. Even
little children come by themselves."  
  
  
  At the union of four streets a small altar was erected.


\"I suppose the procession will pause there, and some
ceremony will take place," said Maude, whose
enthusiastic admiration over Roman Catholic customs
had lately caused her friends some amusement. All
Maude did or said was considered more or less amusing.


Mrs. Seymour began to get a little uneasy, and had
said to Kate:


\"You know your sister is more than half a Romanist
already, and I do not know what I should do if she
turned altogether, while you are partly under my
charge. It would be so awkward, and Major Severne
here too."


\"Don't tell him which is her Roman Catholic half,"
answered Kate, " or nothing will induce him to sit
down on that perverted side of her, and if it is her
right side he won't shake hands either—and the shower
of tracts that will descend!"


After a short mass, a part of the procession formed
and passed out of the church—Maude and Ada going also
—a choir of many voices chanting on their way till the
sounds grew soft in the distance. Half an hour later
the procession passed down the wide boulevards in
front of the hotel, having then acquired monster
proportions.


Kate, Maude, Ada, and Walter stood in the street
regarding it. Major Severne would not look on so sad
a demonstration of ignorance and idolatry, so Mrs.
Seymour would not either, though she would much
have liked to have done so.
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 110 -->

Harry was about to go—he had heard descriptions
of these great religious demonstrations, and was rather
eager to see one, but some expression in Major Severne's
eye restrained him.


\"Don't you want me to go ?" he said bluntly. " Then
I won't."


\"On these occasions you can hardly avoid taking off
your hat as the Host passes, and that is adoring an
idol."  
  
  
  "Is it?" answered the lad; "well, I won't go."


He had inwardly sworn allegiance to a leader, and in
spite of Kate's mocking glance, and the doubtful logic
of the assertion, he held to his allegiance. But might
he not have reverently bowed before the consecrated
symbol of sacrifice, without worshipping an idol ?


A considerable crowd had gathered on the footpaths,
leaving clear space in the mainway for the procession
to pass. A priest bearing a gilt cross led the way,
followed by other priests and men bearing banners;
then came a chanting company of priests and laymen,
girls clad in white carrying artificial flowers formed
into branches, garlands, and bunches, nuns marshalling
them along; boys dressed in cassocks and white capes,
conducted by priests, came next.


Now a halt took place; from some distant street
altar the voice of an intoning priest was faintly heard;
those near took up the response, and the sound rose,
and sweUed, and fell through the length and breadth
of the vast multitude. Truly it was an impressive
scene.


Soon the golden cross moved on. As it passed, the
streets were strewn with marigolds, chopped herbage, or
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 111 -->
scraps of coloured paper. In the centre of the long
line was borne a canopy, under which walked a priest
bearing the Host. As it passed, a hush fell on the
nearest portion of the gathering. Some fell on their
knees, others clasped their hands and bowed their
heads; with few exceptions, the men took their hats
off. Now passed more companies of priests and singing
men, more girls in white, more boys. The candles in
the windows were lit as the procession passed.


\"It is grand," said Maude. " Oh that such
demonstrations of faith were possible in England. I am
sure they attract and sustain."


\"Poor, ignorant people!" replied Ada. " I think it is
sad to see such an exhibition of superstition."


\"You think, then, that these people trust only in the
efficacy of form, and are in the dark as to the meaning
of the ceremonies they observe ?"


\"It seems to me that we every day see evidence of
the unmeaning stress laid upon the observance of rites
and ceremonies."


\"It is not unmeaning," exclaimed Maude; " the rites
are great helps and aids, even to those who are too
ignorant to understand the full beauty of the
symbolism."


Walter said, " All religions are based upon a beHef
in the supernatural, so that it is difficult to say which
of the rites attending on them can be called
superstitious and unnecessary; rites that act as aids in
perfecting the natures of those who observe them cannot
be called needless. I know you, Miss Lewisham, will
not agree with me when I say I should be sorry to see
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 112 -->
any individual of these simple-minded people worked
upon to become a convert, even to our church. I
think religions adapt themselves to the needs of men.
Different peoples and different nations require different
codes of religious observance. When a people has fitted
itself to receive a purer or higher form of worship, we
usually see a rapid, almost simultaneous revolution in
thought take place, and the purer code is established.
To throw doubt into an uncultured mind is introducing
the elements of anarchy."


\"But surely doubt of what is false leads to the
discovery of what is true ?"


\"In many cases that is so, but with Christianity all
Christendom claims to draw its faith from the same
source—the Bible, and the vast number of differing
churches and sects show how many different meanings
may be understood, how many different structures may
be raised, while the fundamental base is the same.
You look with pitying compassion on these people, and
they feel their superiority to us English heretics. I
do not wish to convince them they are wrong. I
believe all do well to remain in the Church of their
baptism; those who change often fail to find the
perfection they seek, while they raise a host of doubts
and fears in others. I should hke to say to them,
' Eemain in your Church. Quit you like men, and be
strong.' Weak-minded people, because they cannot
bear a state of doubt, rush from one extreme to another;
they cannot exercise moderation or self-control, and
probably end by losing all faith. ' The avoiding of an
error leads to a fault if it lack skill,' said Horace."
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 113 -->

One great charm that Walter found in Ada was that
■she suffered him to talk out his thoughts, and did not
dart off to some other subject, as Kate was apt to do
when bored b.y her lover's philosophy.


Our party was now approaching the English chapel,
Forbes and Ada Lewisham a little ahead of the others.


\"I do not think that if people find themselves in a
wrong path they commit a fault by changing into what
they believe a right one."


\"Granted, as a rule; but if paths lead from the same
ground, aud conduct to the same destination, a traveller
goes out of his way, losing time and strength, when he
cuts across from one to another; you are not so bigoted
as to say the paths will not lead to the same
destination ?"


\"No—not quite—but if our conscience tells us we
are wrong, I think we must seek what is right. I think
a habit of indifferentism may lead to disbelief as much
as a habit of change. I "  
  
  
  " Now I think I read your "thoughts."  
  
  
  " Do you ?"


\"Do you remember," said Walter, " once accusing me
of budding a palace for myself to live apart from others
in ? I think you were hard on me; but I have tried
ever since to mix more with others, to care for and with
them, though my soul never did say—  
  
  
  '•'' I care not what the sects may brawl,

I sit as God, holding no form of creed,

But contemplating all.'"


\"Indeed, I was not thinking of that. I do not
remember ever saying so," Ada answered, adding, " but it
does not seem so inappropriate to what you said."  
  
  
  8
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 114 -->

\"I cannot see the application, though I thought the
idea might have recurred to you. I said I wished every
one to adhere to the form they were brought up in. A'
climbing plant is apt to get broken when detached from
its support, though it may find another."


\"But you seemed to think one form much the same
as another, and I have not been able to help thinking
sometimes that you consider religion more-needful for
the poor and ignorant than for clever, educated people;
and it has grieved me "  
  
  
  In a low voice he said:


\"Grieved you! You grieved for me! I do not sit
as God, holding no form of creed, but as a weak human
creature, finding my faculties insufficient to know light
from darkness, truth from falsehood."  
  
  
  CHAPTER XII.  
  
  
  A DISARRANGEMENT OF EQUANIMITY—MAJOR SEVERNE  
  
  
  SEEKS TO OBTAIN A CONVERT.


\"The finer the nature, the more flaws it will show through
the clearness of it; and it is a law of this universe, that the
best things shall be seldomest seen in their best form.

\"The wild grass grows well and strongly, one year with
another; but the wheat is, according to the greater nobleness of
its nature, liable to the bitterer blight."
Buskin : Stones of Venice.

One day, soon after the conversation last recorded, some
of the ladies of our party went to drink milk in the
hospital gardens—a favourite pastime of the sojourners
at Aix. Major Severne escorted our friends to the place
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 115 -->
where the patient assemblage of cows and goats were
being milked, and the crowd of invalids, time-killers,
and eager children were imbibing and demanding "lasses
of milk.


After watching the scene for a minute or two, Major
Severne left the ladies to refresh and amuse themselves.
Turning into a quiet path, he drew out his inseparable
companion—a red Testament—and read and meditated.
His meditations were not altogether concerning his
reading; some of them ran in this wise :


\"Weak, unfaithful servant, why do you lack courage
to serve your Master, to warn a fellow-creature on the
brink of a pitfall ? More than once have you faded to
show forth your faith when you ought to have done so,
and even for such slight cause as the mocking laugh in
that girl's bright eye. You waver and are silent because
of her laugh and his satire, not even because you have
felt the satire, but because you fear you might feel it.
His voice, his gentle consideration and pleasant ways,
have twice indescribably soothed and calmed fits of
nervous suffering I cannot repress, when I can hardly
help yielding to irritation, or even passion. My heart
goes out towards him; I love him and yearn over him,
though I shrink from speaking to him of the one thing
needful, of which it is borne upon me that he knows
but little, that he is unregenerate, trusting in the vanityr
of reason, and in moral codes constructed by heathen.
How can I offer the right hand of friendship to one that
denies my Lord ? I will hold back no more, I will
strive to convince him of sin, and peace and rest, that
are only with Thee. Lord, give me strength!"  
  
  
  As he walked on, absorbed in his thoughts, heper8—2
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 116 -->
ceived, without noticing him much, a man sitting on a
bench nearly at the end of the walk. The man was
leaning forward, one hand shading his face; he did not
seem aware of Severne's approach, but appeared lost in
reflection. At the end of the walk Major Severne turned,
and saw that the man was walking quickly towards him
—he still seemed unconscious of another presence than
his own. It was Walter Forbes.


He looked absolutely older—on his face, in his eye
was a strange expression. Nor was this all that startled
Major Severne as he noted him, and immediately placing
himself full in the other's path, he looked at him steadily,
saying sternly and commandingly, " Come with me,
Forbes," led the way back to the seat, seated himself,
motioning to Walter to do the same, which he did.


There was a silence of some moments, during which
Walter's proud spirit strove hard to regain
self-possession in the presence of his fellow.


\"Well, Severne," he said at length, " did you want to
say anything ?"


\"Yes, thank God!" And Walter met a glance of
stern, deep, sorrow.


He turned away, stood up as if to go, sat down again,
leant his face in his hands, and sobbed.


Some hours later, two friends—Major Severne and
Walter Forbes—walked back to their hotel together.
They were met on the staircase by Kate.


\"Ah ! here you are," she said. " We have wondered
what had become of you."


' I fear we have been plotting treason," said the elder
man, " We have been planning an expedition up the
Rhine together to-morrow, and must start early."
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 117 -->

\"Going up the Rhine !" exclaimed the girl. " Why,
Walter, what a sudden freak !"


\"Yes, is it not ?" he answered. '" I must tell my
mother. Good-bye, Kate!" And he held out both his
hands.


She took them, and looked at him. The pallor and
gravity of his face became reflected in hers. She merely
responded " Good-bye."


Some days afterwards Major Severne and Walter
were walking along the bank of the broad Rhine near
Coblentz; the great calm majestic river had spoken
words of peace to a self-reproachful, restless mind.
Loving and beautiful nature had again applied balm,
and oil, and strength-giving elixir to the healing of the
wounds of her faithful votary. Nature had carried on
the cure begun by those good medicines for a wounded
remorseful heart—merciful judgment and human,
Christlike love and sympathy; and yet these feelings were
understood to exist rather than spoken about.


The two travellers had conversed together but little,
and that little on very ordinary topics; but Severne
knew the man he watched and cared for must be treated
very gently and tenderly, so that he should hardly
perceive any treatment was applied.


Now, at the time of this walk the patient was better;
his mind had in great part recovered from the storm
that had swept over it, and Major Severne told himself
he must no longer delay to give his Master's message, to
try and obtain a proselyte for the cause he served, a
recruit to fight beneath the banner he loved; so he
arranged that walk, and when they had passed beyond
the walls of the city, beyond the pretty vine-clad houses
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 118 -->
with tasteful gardens stretching down to the water, as
the cool of evening crept sweetly over the senses, and
the great water-flood reflected sunset tints as it swept
quietly and impassively to its -ultimate destiny, then
diffidently and hesitatingly, as if he were recalling some
half-learnt words, Major Severne said :


\"Will you bear with me for a little if I say something
that will vex you—if I ask a question which you may
think I have no right to ask ?"  
  
  
  Walter paused before he answered gravely:


\"I think you are going to touch on subjects we shall
not think alike on, but you know that I will gladly hear
anything you wish to say to me. Could it be otherwise ?"  
  
  
  " Thank you," said the other.


The two men had been resting. Major Severne got
up, took a short turn, came back, stood in front of
Walter, and began to preach a sermon, Walter also
standing.  
  
  
  With much effort, and speaking low, Major Severne said:


"There is a natural shrinking in man to give a
message that may not be well received, to ask a question
that men do not love to answer. My Master entrusted
me with a message. Has He not said, ' He that hath
My word, let him speak My word faithfully ?' I have
been weak and faithless. I have often turned aside,
and seared to ask the question, to give the message.

' " Walter Forbes, are you seeking for the truth of the
Lord ? He bids me say to you, Come; pause not, wait
not; come! His yoke is easy, His burden is light, and
you will find rest."


By degrees the hesitancy and timidity of the speaker
passed away. He spoke fluently as familiar words
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 119 -->
recurred to him, and light came to his eye, a flush on
his pale cheek.


\"Hush! do not answer me yet; let me speak while
He gives me strength!


"I have noticed that you are assailed by doubts;
bring them to the feet of the Lord: they will be
scattered, and pass away as the mists of the morning
before the rising sun. I have marked you closely, and
I fear you have been enticed from the faith by words
of man's wisdom, that you trust in your own weak
reason, rather than in the infallible truth of God.


\"I warn you while it is yet day; behold, the night
cometh in which no man may work. Avoid that
snare, distrust the sophistry of reason, and the reasoning
of sophists, that pitfall dug by the evil one to entrap
the unwary. Fall at the feet of the cross, trust in the
blood that was shed there, purify your heart by faith;
faith alone can save you. He entreats you, He begs
of you to turn to Him and be saved."


There was silence for a minute. Walter laid his
hand on his friend's shoulder, and said:


\"Thank you, Severne. Few would have the courage
or the kindness to speak so. In whatever we may
differ, I honour truth, -reality, and consistency, the more
•because I rarely find them. Do not forsake me; bear
with me, though I cannot see the starting-point of
religious faith as clearly as you can. About religious
thought a great gulf lies between me and you. We
•can hardly talk to each other across it, or bridge it over.
You say doubt is sin, 1 say doubting may bring us to
the finding of truth. The sequence of doubt is
knowledge. I am not a sophist, any more than many
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 120 -->
who, like me, cannot see the beginning or end of faith.
To speak of the sophistry of reason is to misapply the
term. Sophistry relates to the moral integrity of the
reasoner, not to the accuracy or inaccuracy of
thereason, and forgive me for saying sophistry of reason is
a party cry, and has little more sense in it than most
party cries. I seek for truth as humbly and earnestly as
you think you hold it. Let this be our bond of union."


\"I cannot argue with you. Your education has fitted
you to wield for good or bad the weapon of subtle
speaking; mine has not. As to the starting-point of
faith, has not God Himself revealed it to us ? and
certainly I hold that to doubt His word is sin. I can
tell you, and testify to the life-giving power of His
word. I would have you drink of the waters of faith.
I have tasted, I can tell you they are sweet. I have
been in trial and temptation, in weariness and faintness;
I know I must have fallen, had not the hand of the
Lord held me up, had not faith in His glorious revelation
sustained. In His strength I have scattered and sown
the word of life among thousands. I think that,
though some fell by the ' wayside and perished,' some
grew and bore fruit. When I have done preaching and
expounding, I have sometimes asked those of my hearers
who had doubts and difficulties to remain in
thenplaces and speak to me privately, while the mass went
on their way. Many did so, and one or two told me
afterwards that I had given them certainty instead of
doubt, and had stilled troubled waters of fear. Dear
friend, tell me why you doubt; even while you speak
the mists may disperse, and the scales fall from your
eyes."
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 121 -->

Walter answered to himself, " It were better that a
millstone were hanged about my neck." Aloud he
said :


\"Severne, you have told me of your convictions, and
I am deeply grateful. Who would not gladly listen
toa relation of convictions ? Shall I make s6 poor a
return as to tell you of my doubts ? Never ! Do not be
angry; theological discussion is ground I tread not on.
Waters that have gathered strength from different
sources meet at last, flowing into the same ocean. I
would wish to think that it may be so with you and me.
You seek to teach men of One purer, higher, and better
than themselves; you lead them to look forward- to a
future fuller and brighter than the present. You work
for a noble end. More than that you have
accomplished; you have gained power over the hearts of
many, and they try to follow where you lead."


\"I cannot say I have worked as I might have done;
but I want to work; I want to help others to seek
what is better and truer; I look to find what is truest
and best in a future beyond the day of death. Nothing
can be gained by telling you of my doubts; but I have
gained by the lessons you have taught me, and I thank
you."


\"If the truth is indeed borne upon you, if you have
found bread cast upon the waters, thank God, not me."


"Example is more than precept. You have shown
me how beautiful is the rule of Christ, as I have never
been shown before; as for churches and dogmas, they
all serve an end and do good work, but as the Hebrew
poet says,' I see that all things come to an end, but Thy
commandment is exceeding broad.' "
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 122 -->

\"That sounds well, but I fear you deceive yourself.
YTou say you seek for what is true and pure: so might a
heathen. Faith only, which is a vision of the unseen
Saviour, can deliver us from the corruptions of the
world. Gazing on Him, we may subdue in part the
selfishness and sin ever at war with our better natures.
We must walk by faith, and not by sight. I do not
hold with doctrines and dogmas of man's creation, but
with gospel revelation of truth. If, as from your words
you would seem to wish me to think, we can both
worship the same Lord, we are not so far apart as I
thought; bear with me yet, and answer if this is so.
Do you worship Christ ?"  
  
  
  After a pause, almost in a whisper, Walter answered:


\"I do. You question what I have not dared to
question with myself; if unbidden the thought has
come into my mind, I have stifled it ere it was asked.
I will try to answer you honestly. Association,
reverence, teaching instilled in childhood, a sense of
communion and fellowship with others, and, above all, fear
of reproach from eyes that, though passed from vision,
are ever present to my memory, have combined to make
me shun encroaching upon holy ground. You have
hardly done well in dragging the question before me.
You think I trust in my reason. You mistake me
greatly. Every day I live I feel more and more
strongly how unfathomable are the depths of
knowledge, how inefficient aud limited the sounding-line of
reason wherewith man seeks to prove them. Do I
worship Christ, the son of God ? Who am I, that I
should say, ' I believe God is love, and the rule of
Christ is a rule of love '? Where in the past, where in
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 123 -->
the present, is such another man ? Never man spake
like He did; so divine a man was certainly God. I
cannot choose but worship at His feet, and bow to the
name of Jesus of Nazareth."


\"Walter, this is not faith, it is a mixture of reason,
unreason, and poetry. I pray that you may attain to
higher truth."


\"I would that I could say I believe wholly as you
believe; I think I do say that your God is my God. I
owe as much to you as man can owe to man, and owing
it you, I am content. Thank God that it was you,
and you only, that saw me in that hour of cowardly
weakness. Pray that I may be such as you are."  
  
  
  CHAPTER XIII.  
  
  
  ADA'S JOURNAL.  
  
  
  Aix-la-Chapelle, Aug. 30th.

"We have been here ten days. I intended to have
written a journal of all I did and thought and saw,
regularly each day, but somehow I have not succeeded
in doing so.


'" Mrs. Seymour got us all to come to this place; she
is the life and spirit of the party, and is always doing
something kind and good-natured for one or other of us,
but now and then she gets ruffled and put out of temper
about some apparent trifle, when she shows how very
cross she is feeling most unaffectedly. I cannot help
looking amused at her sometimes, which does not mend
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 124 -->
matters. The other day she scolded a driver because
he did not speak English. When first we started on
our drive, the man had spoken a little English, but his
small vocabulary being exhausted, he spoke German,
and could not understand what Mrs. Seymour said to
him, upon which she quite lost her temper, and told
him not to pretend he could not talk English, for that
he could quite well if he liked; there was no occasion at
all for his speaking gibberish.


"Here we are thrown into such intimate relations
with each other that, although we all knew each other
well before, new traits seem to come out in the
characters and dispositions of all. I used to think Mr?.
Seymour quite charming, and now I think rather
differently of her at times, owing to many little things
having happened here which have brought to light
sundry spots and flaws lying close beneath the surface
of her charmingness, -which at home I should never have
had an opportunity of observing. I knew she was fond
of hearing and repeating gossip, but I did not know
how much the repetitions were altered and embellished.
She professes to hold rather evangelical principles, and
I knew that she did not go to balls and theatres. She
is very fond of society and parties. I was unaware that
her views were particularly strict, but here she has
certainly been very pious, and this I attribute to the
influence her friend Major Severne has over her. He is
in this hotel, and is, I should think, a very good, sincere
man, but dreadfully Low Church.


\"Last Sunday some of us went to the Botanic Gardens
to hear the band play. We talked about going in- Major
Severne's presence; I do not remember that he said
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 125 -->
anything, but I somehow understood that he was
displeased, and Mrs. Seymour spoke about it in a tone
that certainly implied she thought us wicked to go.
While we were in the gardens, we saw Major Severne
come out of the hotel and walk down the street on his
way to the Lutheran chapel; as soon as he had turned
the corner, Mrs. Seymour came out and joined us, with
a look of much satisfaction on her face. A Lady
Dashforth, who is staying at another hotel, sat near us; soon
she and Mrs. Seymour were talking scandal very
unscrupulously, with great gusto.


\"Walter Forbes is very unlike his mother. I consider
him my friend, and hope he may always be so. Once
or twice, lately, he has rather vexed me by
sayingthings which gave me ideas I could not entertain;
perhaps I was mistaken; I do not mean to think
about it.


\"I have tried to draw comparisons between him and
Major Severne. They have both courteous, refined
manners, and fastidious tastes—Walter the most so;
both are unselfish and good, both have somewhat of the
same sensitive nature, and quick comprehensions of
the feelings and sentiments of others; both wish to get
people to love and see what is good and great and
high. Major Severne, when he left school, entered
the army; he has seen battles, won distinction, and
been a man of action all his life; but although an
educated gentleman, I should not think he has ever had
the leisure, even if he had the inclination, to read and
think as much as Walter Forbes has done, nor, I should
think, is he gifted with as much intellectual power. I
do not imagine that his attainments or understanding
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 126 -->
exceed mediocrity; he spends his life, his health, his
means, in seeking to revive and sustain in all the faith
he knows and has proved to be life-giving and
strengthening; to this end he holds prayer-meetings,
preaches, and gives away tracts.


"I do not quite understand the way in which he
applies the terms converted and unconverted. I have
heard him speak to Mrs. Seymour of persons being
unconverted, who are certainly good, as well as
beingprofessors of orthodox Christianity.


\"I like and respect him much, and have felt the
power of his influence enough to have caught myself
expressing by word or look a little more interest in some
of the subjects he spoke about than I really felt. I
think Harry Gresford is on the way to be quite '
converted.' A great deal of Major Severne's influence lies
in the charm of his manner, which, when he is speaking
to those he feels inclined to like, is veryT prepossessing
and attractive; he speaks with effort, and is shy with
those he dislikes; I can see that some people are almost
repulsive to him, and he tries to overcome the feeling.


\"The influence, example, and zealous endeavours of
such a man to teach religion must do incalculable good.
I fear Walter Forbes will never do as much by his
writings; he is too fastidious and ddettante; I am sure
he sits in his luxurious study, reading and dreaming,
questioning and doubting, and doing little, though he
calls it preparation for doing. I cannot help liking
him; I wish I could respect him more. I think if he
were my brother I could get him to do something
steadily. Lately I have been afraid that he is a little
unsettled about religion, and I am very sorry; it is a
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 127 -->
difficult thing to express in words, but I have a feeling
that somehow his nature will never let him slip
altogether away from religious faith; there is too much
poetry, sense of beauty, and fitness of things in him for
that—to a poet-mind all nature is ever imparting holy
thought. I wish he felt more strongly that our Reformed
Church is right, and that other Churches have a great
deal of wrong in them, instead of thinking them all
much the same: for his sake I am glad Major Severne
is here. Kate Gresford is very pretty and merry, but
not fitted to exercise much influence over such a man
as Walter Forbes; she is thoughtless, and rather
ignorant.
D


"Dear Aunt Jane has on the whole enjoyed being
here; she has been greatly astonished at many things,
and the hotel life was very strange to her; baths have
done her good; both she and Mrs. Seymour make
quite an occupation of looking into the windows of the
shops on each side of the hotel; they go every clay to
see if anything has been freshly placed in them.


"I have not done much sketching; Kate Gresford
and I have made several attempts to sketch the
market; once we tried from the steps of the
Rathhaus, which is the quietest place we could find. It
is not a good position, as, although you can see well,
you are raised so much above your subject. After'we
had sketched there a little while, Walter and his
mother came to us; he smiled at Kate's sketch, and
merely said she was drawing very naturally, if not
artistically; she had tried to get as many figures as
possible on her paper: the groups ran into one another
without arrangement or proportion being observed; the
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 128 -->
result was a little like the composition of an early-glass
figure window.


\"I had only attempted a single figure—an old woman
with a characteristically German face, wrinkled and
weather-beaten; her dress, a red petticoat and jacket of
striped print, a white kerchief on her head. By her side
stood a big jar of grey and blue faience, in which she
had placed some of her bunches of flowers to keep them
fresh; on the stall in front of her piles of greens,
carrots, turnips, and flowers, the background a bit of
an old grey house; a shadow fell across the stall and
subdued the bright tints of the merchandise, while the
face of the woman and part of her dress were in full
light. Mr. Forbes criticized my sketch rather severely,
I thought. I disputed some of his criticisms, and we
had a warm discussion about them. As we returned
to the hotel Mrs. Seymour seemed cross aud vexed,
and now I think she always dislikes me. If I have
done wrong, it has been without intention.


\"I had a letter from John yesterday; there is now
no chance of his coming here; somehow, I do not feel
so sorry as I ought to be. I love him as dearly as I
have always done, and respect him altogether, or I
never would have given him the promise I have given.
He is a man of action, always doing something for the
good of others; I am proud of him, and proud of the
way he is thought of in the county, and yet, and yet,
I wish more strongly every day that I could put off the
time that draws nearer, and live my own life with
Aunt Jane for a year or two; I cannot bear to leave
her, and now she depends on me so much.  
  
  
  '■' I read this morning—I have thought of it in
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 129 -->
connection with Walter Forbes—Keble's beautiful thoughts
for Palm Sunday:  
  
  
  " Ye whose hearts are beating high
With the pulse of poesy,
Heirs of more than royal race,
Fram'd by heaven's peculiar grace
God's own work to do on earth,
(If the word be not too bold)

Giving virtue a new birth,
And a life that ne'er grows old."


\"I wrote the preceding before breakfast. On entering
the breakfast-room, I heard that Major Severne and
Walter Forbes had started early this morning for a
tour on the Rhine; dulness seems to have taken
possession of all of us; Mrs. Seymour and the Gresfords
talk of starting homewards to-morrow, and I suppose
Aunt Jane and I shall follow them soon."


From earliest time, in every successive age, in every
country, we find record of a curious propensity in man
and woman to endow matter, animated and inanimated,
with fictitious qualities, then, bowing down, adore the
material shape, unconscious that it is wrapped about
and glorified to their vision by reflections from
themselves, and that which they would worship is the
deceptive illumination, although they labour under the
singular delusion it proceeds from and interpenetrates
the idol, while, in fact, if they have not created the
image, their imagination has created its divinity.


Ada Lewisham had been exalted into a divinity by
some one or two of her fellow-mortals, and to one of
them at least so beautiful and dazzling was the halo of
false light that enveloped her, that if any failings and
earth-stains were there, they were invisible to his  
  
  
  9
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 130 -->
sight. And, alas! it must be confessed that Ada was
not quite devoid of failings and earth-stains. What
dweller upon earth is or can be ? She admired
unselfishness in others; she herself was perhaps a little
egotistical, at least to the point of having a wakeful
eye as to her own interest. She was affectionate, and
touched by the affection of others, but she had not, I
think, what could be called a loving nature; she had a
calm, evenly balanced temperament, and was seldom
excited to great joy or great sorrow. That silent
monitor called conscience, or, by some, ethical
perception—apt at times to interfere with inconvenient
vetos about our wishes and pleasures, succeeding, if we
venture to disregard its negatives, in making us so
uncomfortable and uneasy that gratification of wishes is
not gratification, and pleasurable indulgence is not
pleasurable—this entity usually behaved itself very
nicely with regard to Ada, and let her act to her own
satisfaction, or, if consulted, responded, when she pleaded
before it, with a favourable verdict.


"Think well of yourself, and your friends will be
sure to think well of you," was a verity about this
young woman.


Really, there was every reason to think well of her;
she was well-principled, sensible, never likely to be
hurried by foolish impulse into inconsiderate action.
There were unsounded depths in her nature, depths she
herself knew not of, that might be productive of untold
treasure; she was clever, and in some measure
cultivated; she could think; there were no sharp angles in
her temper or disposition. And yet she was not so
noble, so high, so divine as Walter Forbes thought
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 131 -->
her to be. Over nervous, sensitive organisations—
both men and women—she almost cast a spell; the
serenity and security of her self-reliant nature extended
soothing, grateful influence over their senses, as the dew
of heaven is grateful to a thirsty land. These nervous
people she eminently attracted, and was attracted
by; for we love the kingdom we reign over, and the
physician loves the patient that yields to the virtue of
bis art.


Notwithstanding this, from some divergement of the
probable issue of possibilities, the being she would in
all likelihood journey through life with, was not of
that class of temperament that seemed to possess some
affinity to her own, according to the law of supply and
demand.


Had Ada been a man, she might have possessed no
mean capacity for statesmanship, for she had ability to
see things clearly as they are, and to steer her course
accordingly; if she could not arrange the position of
affairs to agree with her wishes and her will, she wasted
little time in fruitless sighs and murmurs, but arranged
her wishes and her will to agree with the position of
affairs, so instead of finding herself in opposition to
necessities, it often seemed as if she led to and
originated occurrences she in fact only moulded and
coincided with.


All honour to Ada Lewisham; if more were such as
she, and could look at life nor askant, nor askew, nor
dimly, nor through coloured mediums, but honestly in
the face with opened eyes, and rule themselves suitably,
there would be fewer heart-aches and discontents, fewer
disappointments, fewer mortals who have finished life

sadly, failing to find the good they sought, or to near
the accomplishment of their aim.  
  
  
  CHAPTER XIV.

AUTUMN FOGS—HOW SOME CRUMBS OF MAJOR
SEVEKNE'.SBREAD WERE PICKED UP.  
  
  
  " Ah, Love, but a day,

And the world has changed !
The sun's away,

And the bird's estranged;
The wind has dropped,

And the sky's deranged :
Summer has stopped."  
  
  
  Browning.

It was the end of November; brown and yellow leaves
were littering the ground beneath the trees in Walter's
garden; there had been rain; mist and fog still hung
about, keeping the leaves limp and rain-soaked, so that as
Walter walked on them, instead of rustling pleasantly
beneath his feet, they merely dulled the sound of his
tread.


The presence of the leaves at all, the neglected look
of the garden, told that Francois was away.


Walter Forbes did not seem much to notice the leaves
or the state of the garden; he walked to the gate, and
stood regarding a faded laurel arch that spanned the
road. From the centre of the arch hung a piece of
pink calico, on which, though blurred, and partly
defaced by the action of the weather, he read the motto,
\"God bless the happy pair."  
  
  
  He turned, walked back to the house and entered it.
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 133 -->
Bright little Mrs. Seymour was not there; the rooms
looked disconsolate for want of her, the heart of her
son was disconsolate for want of her, although he was
glad to have a day or two by himself, and to make to
her the announcement in writing that he was no longer
engaged to Kate Gresford.


A week previously, at Paris, he had received a letter
from Squire Gresford, very decidedly saying that the
engagement with Kate must come to an end, as he
(Walter) did not seem any nearer to having means to
support her suitably, and had now been trifling and
dawdling on the Continent for a long time, wasting
money and time. It was an angry, unreasonable letter,
Walter considered, and felt sure that the squire had a
fit of the gout, and would probably reconsider his
decision when he felt better. But enclosed was a note
from Kate, in which she said she also thought the
engagement had perhaps better come to an end, and she
acquiesced in her father's desire.


Walter wrote back, demanding an interview, and
saying that from Kate's lips alone would he take his
dismissal. In the morning of this day the interview
had taken place.


Kate, on her way to see Aunt Jane, turning an angle
in the road, came suddenly upon her late betrothed,
apparently engaged looking at a wind-torn placard
suspended from tree to tree across the lane, on which were
the words, " Long life to Mr. and Mrs. Selwynson."


Kate and Walter met face to face. Both turned red,
both were disconcerted and silent for some moments.
She recovered first, and began to talk fast, not knowing
what she was saying.
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 134 -->

\"I did not know you had come back. When did you
come ? Is Mrs. Seymour coming soon ? We heard she
was gone into Cumberland. I am going to see Aunt
Jane, who is not very well; I must make haste. You
are going the other way, are you not ? Good-bye."


\"No, I am coming with you. I want to talk to you.
Do you think you are treating me fairly ?"


She did not immediately answer, and Walter, looking
at her, saw some expression in her face he had never
seen before—a blending of sorrow and pride, a struggle
for firmness. At last she said:  
  
  
  " I agreed with papa it was better we should part."


\"And why ? Mr. Gresford thinks I am not rich
enough, and that I do not adopt means to work and
obtain riches. Do you also think this, Kate ?"


\"I do not care for riches; but indeed it must be as I
have said. We will be friends."


\"Friends ! Then treat me as a friend, child. When
first we met, you were very young; tell me honestly, have
you changed, has it somehow happened that you can no
longer give me your affections ?"  
  
  
  A flash of scorn came from Kate's eyes.


\"I have found out that I made a mistake in ever
giving my affections," she said, " and it is better for you
and for me that it is not too late to draw back."  
  
  
  He answered passionately:


\"You are right. It is well you have such command
over your affections that you can withdraw them." And
opening Aunt Jane's gate for her, he bowed and turned
away.


He was angry, sore, and irritated with himself, with
her, with Mr. Gresford, Mr. and Mrs. Selwynson, with
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 135 -->
all. As he walked up and down that damp garden path,
he told himself that Kate was no better than other
women, that herinnocency and childlikeness were only
ignorance, and now she had learnt to see she might do
better than many a poor scribbler; and yet he knew he
cared much for Kate, and to lose her now, when he had
justseen the dawn of a woman's fulness of expression
in her face, was bitter, He felt very ill-used and
lonely.


Presently he set himself to answer a letter from his
mother, and to inform her of his altered position. In
his mother's letter was a note from Mr. Forbes, telling
Walter he had better pack up his traps, and come to
Cumberland, and bygones should be bygones. " If you
can get that pretty little girl to come with you, why, so
much the better, Sarah would like to become better
acquainted with her."


It had so chanced that when returning from Aix,
Mrs. Seymour and the Gresfords had met Squire Forbes
and his daughter, and been fellow-travellers with them,
and Squire Forbes had been so delighted with Kate, he
began to think Walter's folly in thinking of marriage
excusable, " and after all, the young folk have waited
some time," he said.


To Mrs. Seymour he gave a warm invitation to
Cumberland, which she gladly accepted, feeling no inclination
to await her son's return in solitude at his old home in
the quiet village; also, she felt sanguine that she could
pave the way for his reception also in Cumberland.


Walter read and re-read his uncle's note, and told
himself he could not accept it; he would wander out of
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 136 -->
England again. His house, his garden, his library, his
writings, had lost charm in his eyes, and seemed to
have turned to wormwood and ashes.


If his feelings towards Kate had of late scarce
exceeded an elder brother's affectionateness, they had been
very affectionate. He had always regarded her with
pride and a sense of possession. He recognised the
change in her manner with bitterness, he felt she was
lost to him keenly and severely. If he was
selfreproachful, his self-reproach was smothered beneath
the sense of injury. He told himself Kate had no right
to change, that he had never by word or action failed to
give her her due. It was impossible she should have
discovered any change in his inmost feelings; she had
not penetration enough, she was too childish.


He would not care; things were best as they were.
He could not give her the wealth and luxuries and
gay society she would be sure to desire. He would not
care, and while he said so, he knew he did care, much.


Having completed a letter to Mrs. Seymour, and told
her as best he might of his changed prospects, he
went out in the waning light to decide upon a piece of
ground upon which to erect a building to be used as a
reading-room and night-school.


Fastidious Walter was going to admit the village
population into his cherished seclusion, and did not
abandon his intention because of his distress, or upon
finding that the only suitable site would be in view
from the library window. The expense of
buildingwould have to be defrayed by subscriptions. It was not
probable that subscriptions would flow in so readily and
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 137 -->
to such large amounts as not to render a strict and
parsimonious expenditure needful.


In his discontented mood, our hero took a perverse
satisfaction in picturing the discomfort he should find
in having his vision arrested by the fixed impenetrability
of the dreary red brick wall of an erection bearing a
resemblance to a cheaply built dissenting chapel, instead
of now, in November, looking between tree stems and
branches into distant country, or in summer into depths
of trembling foliage, ever varying with the changing
light.


The plan of starting a reading-room had been brought
forward by Mr. Moore, the rector, some time previously,
when Walter had lately come to Berwerton; and when the
idea was discussed, W'alter had taken interest in it, and
talked eagerly upon the utility of schemes being carried
out that would tend to heighten the intelligence, raise
the tone, and refine the natures of the mdlion. He
showed that he had really read and thought upon the
subject.


After listening patiently, thinking that his new
parishioner was both clever and thoughtful, and would
certainly prove very helpful, Mr. Moore asked Mr.
Forbes if he would give a little time to teaching in a
night-school, or come among the gatherings in the
reading-room occasionally, proposing that a cottage
kitchen or an outbuilding at the vicarage should be
used till a site could be procured.


Then Walter drew back; his disinclination to really
associate with men having half-washed hands and
fustian coats in a small kitchen or close outbuilding
was strong. It was hardly right to leave his mother by
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 138 -->
herself in the evenings; besides, he was reading hard,
with a purpose, and he could not spare time. So he
began an essay upon the subject of refining clay,
which he ultimately put away in a drawer unfinished.


Mr. Moore could not get helpers, he could not get a
site or a kitchen, and his cook scolded him for wanting
the outbuilding, and the scheme fell through.


Intercourse with that man of action, Major Severne,
roused in Walter self-reproach with regard to this and
many other concerns in which his practice had fallen
short of his principles. They were little things, and he
was, perhaps, capable of doing " some great thing." He
intended some day to unfurl a high standard, and wave
others onward from point to point, as with toil and labour
he moved onwards himself. But delay had taken place
about the preparing of this standard, and when his
leadership was asked for in small matters, he shrank from
trouble, and from contact with uncongenial elements.


In Major Severne he saw one possessed of as acute
sensibilities as his own, but who set at naught distastes
and disinclinations, when by so doing he thought he
could serve his fellow-mortals. Walter honoured Major
Severne. We are prone to imitate those we honour and
admire : hence unpractical Walter became practical; he
set aside inclinations to dream and brood over his
misfortunes, he set aside cherished individual feelings, he
decided upon a site for a village reading-room, he wrote
to Mr. Moore, offering the site and a subscription; he
felt better, read his uncle's letter yet again, and accepted
the invitation it contained.

<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 139 -->

from a bad or good centre?


The vision of men and angels may fail, but can
wedoubt there is a vision that can unerringly trace
thelines to their starting-point, and that the good and
faithful servant who, with unflinching endeavour, has
spent himself for many, and taught many to see the

  CHAPTER XV.  
  
  
  A CHANGE OF SCENE.—SARAH FORBES.  
  
  
  " Icicles clink in the milkmaid's pail,

Younkers skate on the pool below,
Blackbirds perch on the garden-rail;

And hark how the cold winds blow !"  
  
  
  Horace Smith.

There was snow upon the mountains and hoar-frost in
the valleys, thick ice upon a little tarn in Cumberland
near Squire Forbes's house; on this tarn were many
persons skating, their figures standing out dark and
clear from white surrounding.


A lady and gentleman progressing hand in hand
engaged in animated converse might be marked as
among the best performers indulging in the
exhilarating pastime. He was Walter Forbes, she
washis cousin Sarah.
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 140 -->

\"You must rest," said Walter; " I. promised not to
let you tire yourself."  
  
  
  " One turn more, and then I will."


The turn was taken, then the speakers sat down upon
a boat lying keel upwards on the shore of the tarn.


\"Poor old Undine! Do you ever use her now ?" said
Walter.


"No, I got in her once last summer, and tried to get
some water-lilies, but she leaked abominably, and I beat
a speedy retreat."


"Do you remember our 'Robinson Crusoe'
expedition ?"


\"Yes, don't I, and how angry papa was with Jones;
when they had hunted for us everywhere they could
think of, we were at last seen on the rock during the
thunder-storm."


\"How did we manage to escape from Jones ? You
were so very small, I thought she kept the most careful
watch and ward over yrou ?"


\"She went downstairs to gossip with Madeleine, and
set us to learn spelling the while; we were precious
little pickles; we had laid the plan two days before; you
were the originator of it, and tempted me."


\"I took Eve's part, did I ? I remember you wanted
to trust to finding bird's-eggs and shellfish, but that I
providentially packed a basket with all the bread and
jam I could find in the nursery-cupboard, and as soon
as we got to the rock we unpacked, and had a feast,
which having concluded, we looked in vain for
shellfish."


\"Then that dreadful thunderstorm came on, and you
took off your jacket and made me put it on, because
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 141 -->
my white frock was wet through, and we both got very
frightened; then came the shouts of the people looking
for us, and at last papa ran down to the lake and

saw us."


\"Poor uncle James! I think his consternation at
seeing his treasured Sarah in such a position must have
been as great as his joy at discovering her. He swam
to us, did he not ?"


"Yes, because, though the boat got adrift and had
gone ashore, we had got the sculls on the rock, so papa
swam to the rock and took the oars, and then came
back for us with the boat. You were ill afterwards.
but I escaped scot free."


\"Let us go and look at the rock; can't we have some
kind of an adventure together again ?"


\"I am ready for anything. Oh, Walter! it is
somuch more like home now you are here; it is like old
times."


\"You must come and see my own home some day. I
want you to feel kindly towards it. Here we are at
the rock. It was a curious taste to think we should
prefer living on this ten square feet of rugged stone,
instead of enjoying the comforts of civilised existence."


\"Ah! sir! you would not abandon the comforts of
civUised existence now, at anyone's instigation. I
suppose we must go home. Will you unstrap my skates ?
I am to see the plan for the reading-room, and you
promised I should read your article for the Eastern
Revieiu before you sent it off."


Every one had welcomed Walter back to his uncle's
hearth; the fatted calf was killed, and no elder brother
grumbled; his cousin took possession of him as of a
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 142 -->
long lost playfellow, and spoilt him and tyrannised
■over him by turns.


Squire Forbes received him as a son arrived at years
of discretion, and therefore to be treated as a man. He
seemed to have put away the remembrance, or all
indications of the remembrance, of Walter's unsatisfactory
selfwilledness; he talked to him freely and confidentially,
and listened to his replies; he was delighted to have
his clever boy again, and the boy was delighted to
have his uncle.


Mrs. Seymour and the squire, walking along the
path to the tarn, saw Walter and Sarah advancing
towards them.


"He's done her more good than all the doctors; he
has done us all good," said the squire.


"How long had Sarah been out of health when you
went abroad ?"


\"She got a cough last autumn, and was very much
pulled down—not only with that, you know—then she
got not to care for anything; Langton called it nervous
•depression. I took her to London, but the doctors
there said there was no positive illness, and advised
she should have change; so I ran back here to set my
house in order, joined her again, and we went to
Switzerland; we were coming home when we met you
and the Gresfords, you know; I liked that pretty Kate;
I think Sarah did too; I do not yet understand why
she has thrown Walter overboard."


\"It was her father's doing; he did not think Walter
rich enough."


\"If that were all—but no, there must have been
{empty}.something more. She looked to me as if she had too
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 143 -->
much spirit to give up her lover at once when her
father told her; after a two years' engagement, too, it
was not using him well. But I can't say the young
man seems very heartbroken. Do you think they really
cared for each other ?"


\"They were both very young when first they met. I
do not think Walter has been to blame in any way. If
they have both found out they could not make each
other happy, it is well it is not too late to separate."


\"Nothing could make you acknowledge Walter to
blame, nor am I blaming him. I confess I do not
understand him. There's a want of ballast about hinr;
he's a right good fellow at heart, but he's half a woman,
and as nervous and excitable as one, though he has
himself pretty well in hand, and pretends to take things
philosophically, and drawl out cynicisms. I wall not
quarrel with him again; in fact, I think the fellow
knew what was best for himself—he would never have
made a lawyer, my Jane said. We talked about him
just before she died;" and the old Squire, sighed.


\"I was sadly vexed when he gave up working for the
bar; he is so clever, and Mr. Seymour's friends would
have helped him on. Then it did seem so ungrateful to
you, and reckless, though Walter never was ungrateful.
Then when poor dear Thomas Hoare left him all he had,
there was not quite the same necessity for his having a
profession," answered Mrs. Seymour.


\"There I don't agree with you. I think all young
men are the better for following some profession for a
year or two; but young people all think they know
best nowadays. There's my Sarah bullies her poor daddy
into doing all she wants done, bless her ! and nothing
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 144 -->
would satisfy Walter but that he must have his way,
which seems to be to do nothing. Never mind, there's
something about the lad makes me love him as if he
were my son, and so did my poor wife; and I really
think he cares a bit for me."


\"That I am sure he does. How could he help it, after
all you have done for him ?"


"Folks do not always care for others because of
benefits received from them, and many a young fellow
would have thought it quits, if flown at and cut off as I
did by Walter, and what's more, I would rather not
think he only cares for me for what I've done for him.
Well, chddren," as Walter and Sarah came up, "had
enough of skating ? Not tired yourself, my darling,
have you ?"


\"No, daddy," said Sarah, linking her arm into her
father's, " I have untired myself. We have on
Robinson Crusoe's Rock. You did not need to swim to
fetch us off this time, did you ?"


"Walter," said Mrs. Seymour, falling a little back,
\"there are a pile of letters and papers come for you this
afternoon, and I had a note from Mrs. Selwynson. She
does not seem to know we are still here. It was
forwarded from Berwerton."  
  
  
  " What does she write about ?"


\"About nothing particular; but I think she wants
us to go and see Aunt Jane, who she says is ill."  
  
  
  " Aunt Jane ill! Not much amiss, I hope ?"


\"Oh no, only a cold, and she is nervous and in a fuss
about herself, I imagine. Ada was over with her last
Monday, and saw Mr. Moore there, who told her we
intended to be at home last Wednesday."
<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 145 -->

\"Ah, I told Moore so before, Uncle James wanted
us so much to stay on," Walter said.


\"Ada says she thinks Aunt Jane wants cheering as
much as anything. She has not been able to get out
much this winter," Mrs. Seymour remarked.


\"We must go back before long. I want to see the
reading-room begun on. Perhaps Uncle James and
Sarah would come back with you, if you suggest it to
them, mother."


\"I wfll ask them; but I do not expect your uncle
wdl come, and I do not think Sarah ought to leave him;
he is much aged since your aunt's death. He is very
fond of you, Walter; perhaps he might give in to
anything you and Sarah much wished."


With these words they entered Mr. Forbes' house,
and Sarah, turning to her cousin, asked him to bring
the sketch of the reading-room and the essay for " The
Eastern Review " into her particular sitting-room.


An hour afterwards Mrs. Seymour, coming into the
room, found a litter of MSS. in her son's handwriting
before Sarah, who was reading, marking passages for
correction, and passing it on, page by page, to Walter.  
  
  
  Mrs. Seymour looked well pleased.


\"You held out hopes of a cup of tea in here, Sarah, or
I should not have ventured into your sanctum."


\"Here is my most comfortable chair, Aunt Nancy. I
wdl ring for tea. I have been thinking about Walter's
papers, and believe I forgot to order it in here," said
Sarah.  
  
  
  "Your father will come and have some, will he not ?"


\"He does not care about it. I think he has gone
into the library, and will perhaps be asleep."  
  
  
  10
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 146 -->

\"Let me go and see; I will go very quietly," said
Walter. " Since we went wild- duck shooting, and I
begged for a liberal allowance of tea in a teapot, instead
of those cold potions sent from the servants' tea, Uncle
James has joined us very regularly at five o'clock, and
has drank tea, much as he despises me for doing so."


\"If he is quiet, we may as well leave him alone; in
fact, I do not want to get him in the habit of coming in
here; it might be very inconvenient."


\"It must, then, be very inconvenient to have me here
so often. I beg your pardon for coming."


\"No, for I should not hesitate to tell you to go away
if I did not want you."  
  
  
  " And do you feel sure I should not rebel ?"  
  
  
  " I think I could enforce obedience."


\"Do you ? At this moment a whim has seized me.
May I gratify it without telling you what it is ?"


\"If it is nothing very outrageous, and my room afford
scope for its gratification."  
  
  
  " Thank you."


And while he spoke, Walter seized a large
drawingboard, placed on it a beautiful old Worcester teapot, into
which he poured half the tea that had just been brought
into the room.


\"Why, Walter, what are you going to do ?" said his
mother.


"Tea is said to have a more perfect flavour when
poured from fine china. I want to prove the assertion."
And appropriating a hot cake and tea-cups, he bore
away his adaptation for a tea-tray, saying, "Imagine
yourself commanding me to leave the room, and obliged
to take refuge with my uncle in the library."
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 147 -->

\"How silly!" said Sarah, rather crossly. " It would
really have been better not to disturb papa."


Mrs. Seymour was amused, and not sorry that Sarah
should have a gentle hint to be less neglectful of her
father.


\"Your father did seem to enjoy meeting us all at tea
and having a talk. Both Walter and I see some change
in him; he seems depressed, and in such low spirits.
Do you not notice that he brightens up when talking ?
The more he can be got to be with us all, the better."


\"There is nothing the matter with him; he always
liked to be a good deal by himself. I take great care
of him, dear old daddy!"


What Sarah's care of her father consisted in, was
perhaps better known to herself than to that portion of
the world at all observant of the matter. She often
■caressed him, and sometimes leant lovingly, but rather
too heavily, on his arm.  
  
  
  CHAPTER XVI.  
  
  
  SQUIRE FORBES.—THE PARSON.  
  
  
  " But times are alter'd; trade's unfeeling train
Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain.
*****  
  
  
  His ready smile a parent's warmth express'd,
Their welfare pleas'd him, and their cares distress'd;
To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven."
Goldsmith.

Squire Forbes had spent his life in well-doing,
according to his lights, and his lights burnt very steadily, and  
  
  
  10—2
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 148 -->
evenly, never throwing out such vivid flashes or brilliant
glares as could cause him to see unsound places in the
paths, or stumbling-blocks, in the way of pursuing the
modes, manners, and habits of his fathers and
forefathers with but slight variations, and few concessions,
to the requisitions of the present age.


Mr. Forbes held to the creed, as to estate
management, to the politics and to the theology of his ancestors;
sheltered and shaded by preconceived ideas and
traditions, he trod a beaten path without hesitation. Like
Walter, he could be tender, and loving, practising nianly
qualities and putting forth protective strength towards
women and weakness.


He had married in middle life a lady considerably
younger than himself, and loved her devotedly. She
had now been lost to him for more than a year; grief
still preyed upon his health and spirits, he was no longer
the hale, hearty, vigorous squire, ready with his joke,
and ready with his wrath, but an old man trying with a
vain effort to stand bravely against a blow that had
stricken him down.


His servants, who loved him, longed to get such
\"blowings up " as they had been accustomed to of yore,
but the squire passed by their errors without notice.
He was missed from public meetings and social
gatherings; guns and fishing-rods hung untouched in their
places; and such time as he did not devote to his
daughter, or to unavoidable business, was passed sitting
listlessly in the library or walking aimlessly about the
grounds.


Of his daughter he was a fond, proud, and
too-indulgent father, making great struggles to be cheerful
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 149 -->
when in her society, and consenting and deferring to
her wishes and tastes.


After her mother's death Sarah Forbes had caught a
cold, which hung on her long, and resulted in a cough
and weakness of the chest. Mr. Langton, the old family
physician from Carlisle, advised that she should go to a
milder climate for the winter, and then travel, bearing
in mind the advisability of a change of thought and
scene for the father, as much as for the daughter. The
advice was carried out.


After a winter at Nice, the father and daughter had
restlessly moved from place to place, going very much
where their courier pleased to take them, neither feeling
in any hurry to return to Cumberland, and renew the
pain of finding the places of wife and mother empty.


Sarah Forbes had been a spoilt child all her life, more
particularly since Walter had gone away; what wonder
then that she had learnt to become a little egotistical, to
consider a little too carefully the relations of things and
actions in connection with her own personal wants and
wishes. She had never had a governess; her mother
had taught her, and in emulation with Walter, she had
learnt much by herself, though somewhat his junior,
entering with keen zest into the literary tastes and
perceptions of the Harrow boy and Oxford man. During
the vacations she and Walter were ever together, in
close companionship and brotherhood.


When he fell into disgrace, Sarah had felt much
indignation against her father, and even against her mother,
for not exerting more influence to effect a reconciliation
—and, in truth, Mrs. Forbes did not much exert herself,
as, although she loved Walter, and would have said
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 150 -->
nothing in dispraise of him to her husband or any one,
she -was not sorry that an interruption should take place
in his frequent returns to Cumberland and unrestrained
intercourse with Sarah. For in the Forbes' family
marriages between cousins were not without precedent,
and were considered as possible and allowable events—
sentiments Mrs. Forbes did not share in.


So after Walter's banishment, missing him sorely, and
feeling cross with both her parents, Sarah shut herself
up a good deal in her room and studied; while they, to
console her for the loss of her companion, indulged her
and bent to her wishes more than before.


In opposition to her father, Sarah had chosen to
profess satisfaction in hearing of Walter's engagement to
Kate, though she had realty been jealous and
dissatisfied, as sisters are jealous when they feel a loved
brother will no longer give first place to their sympathy
or claim it as eagerly as before, that he will turn to
another first in his joy or grief. It was a little hard for
Sarah to feel that Walter was enjoying happy
intercourse with his mother and his beloved, while she was
pining for him in a home where, much as she was
petted and indulged, her father and mother were one,
and she was an outsider.


No long while elapsed before an intention of
extending forgiveness to Walter was contemplated. Then
came Mrs. Forbes' death, and her husband had' no
energy to take any steps towards carrying out his
intention, and shortly afterwards he and his daughter
went on the Continent, returning from whence they met
Mrs. Seymour, as we have seen.  
  
  
  Walter was shocked to find his uncle so aged, and
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 151 -->
altered, in body, and mind; he was also shocked to see
how little Sarah perceived it, and what slight efforts she
made to be of any use, or comfort, to her father; and
though she called him " dear daddy," and was really
fond of him, she became impatient if, wishing for her
society, he called her away from her pursuits. She did
not see that his cheerfulness when with her was forced,
nor did the change strike her from the hale, brief-spoken
squire to the feeble, sometimes garrulous, sometimes
silent, desponding, old man. When the courier told her
how he sat hour after hour doing nothing, she replied,
\"He liked it: he did not care for reading."


The arrival of Mrs. Seymour, and afterwards Walter,
had already done him much good. Mrs. Seymour, with
bright tact, was ever ready to talk at a right time, and
leave him silent when she saw he could not talk. His
heart was touched by Walter's gentleness and quiet
sympathy, while "his fine gentlemanisms and nonsense,"
which would formerly have excited the old squire's
wrath, now in his softened mood, rather amused him.


Walter had never cared much for field sports or
farming, but now he seemed always talking of details,
learnt from the bailiff, respecting the merits of pigs.
cows, or calves; from the grooms about horses; from the
keeper about game or dogs; and once he described the
beauties of a bull he had seen at Mr. Rosthwaite's farm
in such glowing terms, that Mrs. Seymour seemed moved
with a desire to contemplate the wonderful animal, and
asked her brother-in-law to escort her to the farm,
which he did, accompanied by Walter and Sarah.


While they were walking to the farm they saw many
wild ducks. Sarah laughingly asked Walter to shoot
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 152 -->
some, knowing that his skill in slaying, with powder and
shot was limited. Walter said he would if his uncle
would lend him a gun, which the squire not only did,
but actually, to every one's surprise, went himself to
give Walter instructions, though hardly equal to the
exposure to the cold which was entailed.


Accompanied by a perfectly trained retriever, Mr.
Forbes and his nephew walked silently along the
shores of the lake, taking advantage of every bush or
rock to hide behind; presently they saw several ducks
within shot from an old boathouse, the walls of which
were pierced with holes to give facility to wild-duck
shooting; creeping noiselessly into the house, the two
men each marked their bird, and fired at the same
moment into the unsuspecting company of ducks.
MrForbes's first shot killed two, Walter's one, but the
discharge of second barrels after the startled, rapidly
departing birds did no execution. The squire got so
excited he was rather anxious to go to an upper tarn in
search of more, but his nephew dissuaded him, proposing
they should try again on the morrow; that night frost
set in, and the sportsmen had to wait, as the ducks all
went to the sea.


When Walter entered the library, bearing his stolen
refreshment, he found his uncle sitting by the fire,
looking into it sadly.


\"I longed for the smell of your pine wood fire, uncle,
and I am going to have some tea here, if you do not
mind."


"All right," answered the squire, without looking
up, then adding, " Where are the ladies ? I looked
into the drawing-room, but could find no one."
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 153 -->

\"They are in Sarah's room, and seeing in their faces
that they meant to discuss fashions"—(Oh, Walter!
Walter!) " I beat a retreat, venturing to bear away some
spoils. Let me give you some tea."


\"No, thank you"—and the squire looked most
contemptuously at the arrangements for tea, "it is only
you luxurious young fellows want five o'clock tea. I
can remember the time when we never had it for
breakfast; my father had strong beer, so did his father
before him; very often there was not tea in the house,
even for the women; you may give me half a cup if
you like, just for fellowship."


A servant opened the door, and announced, Mr.
Skidtwaithe.


"Well, Skidtwaithe, glad to see you. Coming to dine
with us this evening ?"


"No, squire," said the thin, plain, harsh-featured
man who entered the room clad in rough grey cloth,
\"I am on my way to our night school, and cannot stop
to dine with you; but I looked in to tell you that old
Musgrave won't be able to hold his land much longer,
and I thought you might like to make a bid for it
before Sir James does."


\"Musgrave! I am sorry to hear he's in a bad way;
he's such a steady chap, too."


"Nothing would satisfy Robert Musgrave but that
he must go to his uncle in Kendal and learn car-:
pentering; then Dick came from Grasmere to help on
the farm and work for his father, but he didn't do half
as much work as Robert. Then a lot of their sheep died,
partly through neglect, I think, and they have lost much
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 154 -->
in one way or another. I don't think they can hold on
much longer."


\"You see, as Sarah won't have this place, it's no good
my buying land, unless my brother would take it
from me."


\"And won't he ? You bought Bilker's piece for him,
did you not ?"


"True. But I had time to write to him about it.
He told me then to buy any desirable bit of land,
adjoining ours, that was for sale. But it's no great
object to obtain Musgrave's. You see the force makes
a good boundary between my land and his. And I do
not know but that it would be more object to Sir James
Scarth to get it than to me. Musgrave's runs into his
land in an angle."


\"Sir James has bought up a good many little farms
lately. He gives a very good price for them; but he
won't rent them to the old proprietors. They all have
to turn out; the homesteads are pulled down; and the
land consolidated into large farms."


\"I thought," said Walter, " the present proprietors
were too proud to sell their land."


"So they are, generally. But you see necessity
drives them to it now and then; the small landholders
cannot compete with the large ones, and the large ones
are more numerous than formerly "


An odd noise ended Mr. Skidtwaithe's sentence, and
Walter, looking at him, saw him replace a capacious
snuff-box in his pocket.


\"I shall be sorry when our old race of yeomen
peasants die out. I always uphold them as being the
finest race of peasantry in England. They are such
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 155 -->
proud, honest, independent fellows, with twice the pluck
and intelligence of southern labourers," said Walter.


\"Well done. I did not think you appreciated North
countrymen half so well. I declare we shall make a
dalesman of you yet. I, like you, grieve to see the old
chaps having to give in and sell their land. I would
far rather have old Musgrave for a neighbour than
some set-up young man, such as Scarth would put in,
who will poison us all, sowing chemical abominations
and radical opinions. Faugh, I know the sort—"
(another pinch of snuff). "Well, squire, what shall
I say to Musgrave ? If you bought it, you might let
him the farm. He'd be a made man with the price of
it for capital; and would make you a good tenant."


\"Ah, ah, parson ! you didu't let out before that you'd
been given a message. Did he think I should let him
stay on ?" x  
  
  
  ✓


\"No; in fact, I did not quite promise to mention the
matter to you; I said I would see about it."


\"How large a sum would it take to keep his head
above water, if I made him a loan instead of buying the
farm ?"


\"A good deal. I would not advise you to do that
you would probably lose your money, and do Musgrave
no permanent good; it would only stave off the evil day
for a little."


\"Well, Twill think about it. Sarah could sell it to
Scarthe, if my brother would not have the land. I like
old Musgrave, and I believe it would be the death of
him if he had to leave."


\"I really think it would. Good-night, squire, I must
go to my lads."
<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 156 -->
  
  " May I come with you ?" said Walter.


\"Yes, certainly; but they won't be much in your
line. We shall have to walk two miles, and you'll miss
your dinner."  
  
  
  Walter answered:


\"That is a consideration; I do not like going without
dinner, but I am rather interested about night-schools
just now. I should like to see one as well managed as
I am sure yours is. Please tell Sarah not to keep
anything warm for me, uncle; I will have some cold beef
when I come in."


As Mr. Skidtwaithe and our hero walked along the
Keswick Road to the building in which the night-school
was held, Walter said :


\"I wonder you can get a night-school together, the
houses are so scattered."


\"They are; but many of the boys and men willingly
walk miles to school, they value teaching so much."  
  
  
  "And do they learn much ?"


\"Two nights a week is too little for them really to
learn much, but they revive and keep up what they
have learnt already, and I can direct them what to read
and learn at home. There will be a large muster
tonight, as it is moonlight."


And there was a large muster, both of men and
sheep-dogs.


Grim smiles of welcome greeted the parson. The
first hour was assiduously devoted to study and reading,
the second hour all wrote, and Mr. Skidtwaithe, going
round and criticising the writing, was frequently stopped
to be told some piece of news, to be asked advice, or
perhaps to be given some; each man and boy seeming
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 157 -->
to think the shrewd business-like parson, dressed almost
like one of themselves, his own particular friend; and
so he was. On breaking up for the night a cup of hot
coffee was served to each.  
  
  
  CHAPTER XVII.  
  
  
  HOW WALTER FORBES BECAME A MAN OF ACTION.  
  
  
  " You might have won the poet's name,

If such be worth the winning now;  
  
  
  * * * *  
  
  
  But you have made the wiser choice,
A life that moves to gracious ends
Thro' troops of unrecording friends,
A deedful life, a silent voice."
Tennyson.

\"Mother," said Walter, coming one day into the
drawing-room, where Mrs. Seymour was writing, " leave off
writing for a little while, and listen to me."  
  
  
  "Well."


\"What do you think my uncle has been saying to
me?"  
  
  
  " I—perhaps I could guess; but tell me."


\"He said I was to talk it over with you. Did he say
anything to you first ? He said he had not spoken to
Sarah."  
  
  
  " No; of course, he left that for you to do."
\"Do you really know all about it, mother ?"


\"No; but I do not think I have guessed wrong. I
have seen for the last fortnight that the squire would
have no objection—and from many points of view it
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 158 -->
would certainly be desirable. She is a good, clever girl,
though a little self-willed."


\"Sarah—yes, she is a good girl, but very self-willed.
She is very fond of you, little mother, and I think you
could be comfortable with her. Do you at all like the
idea of living here in other ways ? My uncle wants us
so much to do so."  
  
  
  " But he hardly means to include me ?"


\"Yes, indeed he does, he said so; and you do not
suppose I should stay if you didn't ? I know I shall long
for my old home and books sadly. Living here is not
all my uncle talked about; he has offered me three
hundred a year to help him to look after the estate and
write letters. I told him that with regard to looking
after the estate, I was quite incompetent; but he is very
much set upon the plan, and thinks that, with Campbell
as head man, I should get on. In fact, he seems so
anxious about it, I am going to consider it. It will make
my way clearer if you will say exactly what you hke.
I do not like your not having a home of your own, and
there is no house about here it would be possible for us
to take."  
  
  
  " I could go back to London."


\"And leave your only son forsaken and lamenting,
you wicked little woman!"


\"My only son will find consolation. But I do not
want to go; I should find any place very dreary now
without my boy."


\"Now you speak like a worthy parent. Then I am
to say yes.to Uncle James ?"


\"His offer seems to me a very good one. You won't
make three hundred a year writing books. Your uncle
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 159 -->
is very much pleased at seeing how much more you
care for practical things, and indeed I have been quite
surprised to hear you talk so learnedly about dogs and
bulls, though I knew it was for your uncle's sake."


\"I feel like a hypocrite; but though at first I only
took trouble to collect news I thought would rouse and
distract Uncle James from his gloom and sadness, now
I really do take more interest in the dogs and bulls than
I could possibly have believed I could. Nevertheless,
as an agent I am thoroughly inefficient; but
Skidtwaithe would help me; and it is not an efficient agent
Uncle James requires—he would quarrel with one
directly. He wants a son, and—and I can be a son to
him—he has been the kindest of fathers to me. I think
he and I could muddle over estate matters together
without their getting into a worse state than they are
in now. Uncle Dick will probably have made his
fortune, and come home in two years, and then the
squire means him to do what he likes. It will be a
very good thing for Sarah to have you with her. You
can take her into society a little."


\"I hope you do not mean to shut yourself up
altogether; Sarah will hardly approve of that. What about
Berwerton; shall you let it ?"


\"No, I could never make up my mind to do that. I
shall keep it open to myself to go down there from time
to time, when bulls and calves are too much for
me."


"Walter !" cried Sarah, bursting into the room, " what
are you doing ? It is a long while past the time for
reading German, and I have been waiting for you ever
so long."
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 160 -->

\"I am sorry to have kept you waiting, but the
squire wanted me, and then I wished to talk to my
mother."


\"It was very tiresome of papa; I am sure he did not
want anything that mattered."  
  
  
  " Let us go at once, I am ready now."


\"No, thank you; waiting fidgets me. I could not
attend now."


"That is the result of possessing an ill-regulated
mind. Come and hear what we have been talking
about. My uncle wants us to live here."


\"Oh," said Sarah, all trace of crossness vanishing
\"that would be delightful! Aunt Nancy, you will stay?
Say you will this moment!"


\"You are very good to wish it, my dear. We are
going to think it over."


\"Oh, you must say yes, without thinking; I cannot
bear waiting. It is a beautiful plan. Your heart's
desire shall be granted at every minute of the day, if I
can grant it. So there now, say yes !"


The squire entering the room while his daughter
spoke, said:


\"I see you are talking over my proposition. If you
agree, it will be the best thing possible for Sarah and
myself; nevertheless, I should hke you and Walter to
consider well if you can be happy here. I will not
make martyrs of him and you."


Then, standing sdently before the fireplace, the old
squire looked wistful and anxious while his daughter
dwelt upon all the advantages of the scheme, and
continued to entreat for an affirmative answer, which -was
not long withheld.
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 161 -->

Mrs. Seymour had become aware that it would be a
good plan for her son to marry his cousin, who would
not be unblessed with means to soften the hard corners
of life, when that can be done by rubbing off the
angularities with glittering gold—not that Mrs. Seymour was
altogether influenced as to her wish by the glitter of
gold; she truly believed that Sarah would be very likely
to make her son happy; their tastes seemed to her to
be similar; there was freshness and originality about
the girl, while her undisguised affection, devotion, and
admiration, for pretty little Aunt Nancy won that lady's
heart.


Sarah was self-willed and exacting; but then
exactingness and self-will are more excusable in the heiress
to fifty thousand than in a young woman of no
expectations. Sarah was not pretty, but there was a wild grace
in her movements and much that was engaging about
her, when shyness did not make her put on a
forbiddingsort of manner.


Mrs. Seymour was of a sanguine disposition, and
usually discovered that what she wished was on the
way to be accomplished; so she thought she had
discovered evidence of more than cousinly affection in
Sarah's devotion to Walter. In another she would have
resented the betrayal of such feelings, " but Sarah was
so simple-minded that she could only be liked the better
for being so transparent," thought her aunt.


In consenting to his uncle's project, Walter made no
slight sacrifice of his own wishes; for though he had
recently declared to himself that his house, garden and
library had lost all charm to him, he was, before the
conversation with his uncle, longing to return to them, and  
  
  
  11
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 162 -->
now, at the thought of giving them up almost altogether,
his heart quite sank within him. He took care the
squire should not see that he was making a sacrifice,
and he was really glad to be able to do something for
him, and not something that would cost him nothing;
he was thankful to repay an iota of that lavish kindness
he and his mother had received at the time of their dire
necessity. All the tenderness of his nature went out
towards the poor bereaved, heart-broken squire: he had
already done much more than any other person had
been able to do towards restoring his uncle's normal
mental condition.


The old servants assured him he had done wonders,
it did their " hearts good to see how the squire had
com'd round;" and none could be more active than
were they in endeavouring to fulfil Walter's slightest
behest. The gamekeeper consulted him as to where
new huts for shooting wild-fowl from should be erected,
saying, with a twinkle in his eye, it would be worth
while to make strong ones, as they were not likely to
lose him again, he trusted.


If the twinkle had any special meaning, its meaning
was lost on Walter; indeed, he provoked his mother's
indignation by his insensibility to much that she thought
he should have shown a little feeling about.


By spring the squire had resumed very many of his
former habits, riding about his land and giving orders,
but always wishing his nephew to accompany him and
discuss matters with him; consequently, the agent's
duties were not very arduous, and a source of much
amusement and many jokes to Mr. Skidtwaithe, who
never seemed very favourably disposed towards Walter.
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 163 -->

Riding by that gentleman's house one day, Walter
stopped to deliver a message from his uncle.


The parson was not within, said a forbidding-looking
housekeeper; she thought " he was seeing to the
sheepshearing." The surmise was correct, with the exception
that, instead of merely seeing to the shearing, he was
shearing. Attired in garments now ceasing to resist
the ravages of time, the reverend gentleman was
himself engaged in releasing a woolly mother from her
winter clothing. He did the work with speed and skill,
from time to time addressing words of admonition to his
surrounding satellites.


Operations were going on in a barn, the operators
sitting in a semi-circle, a large can of beer or cider in
their midst. Mr. Skidtwaithe put the finishing touches
to the separating of a fleece from its owner; the animal,
on being freed, ran bleating to join its companions
in the fold-yard. Seeing Walter, the clergyman rose
and came forward, brushing from his clothes, as he
advanced, some small white parasites that had fallen from
the sheep.


Walter instinctively recoiled, which Mr. Skidtwaithe
did not fad to notice.


"Well, baillie, how's your shearing getting on. I
suppose you've been working your hand in ?"


"No. I am not as clever as you are. My
uncle asked me to call and ask how you thought
Musgrave was going on now ? And he would be
very glad if you wouldn't mind looking over the
title-deeds. Jarvis, from Keswick, is coming about
them to-morrow, at twelve o'clock. Could you come
at the same time ?"  
  
  
  11—2
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 164 -->

"All right. Tell the squire I'll come. Are you
going to Musgrave's now?"


"Yes. I am going to tell him to bring the deeds
to-morrow."


"Don't think you'll find him. He was going to
Featherdale to meet the woolstapler."


\"I am going to Scarth Grange; so I shall pass
through Featherdale, and can look him up. Do you
know where he was to meet the woolstapler ?"


\"Yes. At the Scarth Arms most likely. Is Sir
James come back ?"


"Yes. I travelled with him on his way back the
other day."


\"Ah ! then I suppose the house is full of gay folk by
this time. I heard a party was expected. Do you
know who they are ?"


\"There is only one lady and gentleman there now.
Some more people are to come to-day, Sir James
said."


\"Sir James said ! Did you go there yesterday ? I
saw you and Miss Sarah ride by, and return quite late.
You take care how you take your cousin by Blackfell
in dusk-light, or you'll get stuck in a bog, lose your
way, or break her neck. If you once lose the track
after dark, make a night of it where you are. Do not
attempt to wander about looking for the way. The
nights are bitter cold on the hdl side yet, so take
are."


"I know all the paths very well, and so do the
ponies. But I believe you are right; and it is better
not to try them in dusk light. We did swerve a little
last night; and nearly got in a bog. Good-nicrning."
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 165 -->

\"Good-day to you. If that lad were engaged to my
daughter," muttered the parson, as he returned to his
barn, "I would bring him to reason. He should not
ride, and boat, and talk German heathenism to her,
month after month; then go down south and dangle
after some one else's wife, as my cousin Joe writes me
word about. The child used to have many a smile for
' Uncle Skid,' and bunches of wild flowers for his
parlour; but now, whenever I see her, it's Walter this
and Walter that, till I should like to kick the fellow.
Old fool that I am! I shall have to screw my face into
smiles, marry them, and dance at the wedding, I
suppose!"  
  
  
  CHAPTER XVIII.  
  
  
  A WEDDING, ON DIT.  
  
  
  " As Rochesoucault his maxims drew
From Nature, I believe them true;
They argue no corrupted mind
In him; the fault is in mankind.
This maxim more than all the rest
Is thought too base for human breast,

We first consult our private ends,
While Nature, kindly bent to ease us,

  Swift.

\"He is more delightful than his books, and they are
charming, and that is more than one can say of most
authors. I do hope he wdl be in London next month.
I should so like to have him at our parties. His being
a near neighbour, belonging to our lake country makes
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 166 -->
it so interesting. I shall get him to come regularly
into our set. You must give him orders, and then he
wdl come."


\"I do not think that follows. His cousin may give
him orders to do something else. How long has he
been engaged to her ?"


"I do not know. Sir James did not say. It is a
family arrangement, you know. All the Forbes marry
their cousins; have done so from time immemorial.
And really your friend is rather fortunate; for the girl
is not bad-looking, and will have an immense fortune."  
  
  
  "She does not succeed to the estates ?"


"No. A man who is a bushranger will have them.
At least he lives in Australia; so he might as well be
a bushranger, if he isn't. He has a colonial wife, and
a whole tribe of little bushrangers. It's a great pity!
Failing them, young Forbes is next heir. I wish the
aborigines would exterminate the bushrangers, root and
branch."  
  
  
  " That is rather a murderous wish."


\"Not at all; in Australia people are so used to having
their throats cut, being shot at, and all that, that they
rather hke it. And just conceive the horror of having
a lot of bushrangers for neighbours some day, and
having to call on Mrs. Bushranger."


\"What did you say Walter Forbes' nom de ■plume
was ?"


\"Rufus Retlaw, a most barbarous sounding name; but
every one knows hiswritings. I wonder you don't. It was
by the merest chance I found out who he is. I was at
the station at Keswick, waiting for a train, when I heard
an old Frenchman ask if there was a parcel for Mr. Rufus
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 167 -->
Retlaw. I heard a discussion about Rufus Retlaw's
book not long ago, so the name attracted my attention.
I tried to see the direction on the big parcel that was
given to the Frenchman: it was only ' Rufus Retlaw,
Esq., Keswick; to be kept till called for.' I asked a
porter who the old man was, and he said he was
youngMr. Forbes of Scarcalder's French servant. I shall not
tell any one, of course; it would not be honourable. I
am quite to be trusted."


\"I do not see that you can be quite certain Walter is
Rufus Retlaw."


\"Oh, there can be no doubt about it; and you really
must do me the kindness to make him come to London.
I am very, very particular, but your friend shall come
to my house as often as he likes; to have Rufus Retlaw
at an evening party would ensure its being a success."


\"But you said you would not tell any one; if you do,
I am sure he will not come."


\"I shall not tell any one—I should not think of doing
so; but I can say to people, Rufus Retlaw is a friend of
Sir James', and is always at our house.' I shall leave
them to find out who he is."


The speakers were seated in the drawing-room at
Scarth Grange. One was its fair mistress, a diminutive
lady, with a face like a doll; hke a doll, the colour in
her face was somewhat fixed. She aimed at youthful
simplicity in her morning costume, and her morning
costume became her well. A casual observer might
suppose her not to have seen thirty summers, but she
had seen some half-score more. She spoke with the
slightest possible lisp, which also became her, and was
pretty from her lips; every movement of her hands was
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 168 -->
pretty; she was pretty when, as was not unfrequently
the case, she pouted like a child in a display of
extremely naughty temper. She could talk vivacious
nonsense very charmingly, looking innocently artless;
her manners were often quite fascinating. To those who
did not associate very intimately with her she was
immensely attractive, even while they owned she was a
silly little thing.


Few would have imagined that this little person had
capacity for the indulgence of a ruling and lasting
ambition, yet so it was. For years she had steadily and
indefatigably kept one object in view, step by step,
perseveringly and untiringly pursuing it; and now, when
she had in some measure obtained what she sought, to
retain it in her grasp, continued and unwearied efforts
were needed, and of these she was unsparing; if any
things or persons, friends or enemies, stood obstructing
her way, they were knocked down and trampled in the
mire, provided her strength was equal to the knocking
down and trampling.


And this end and aim of all Lady Scarth's powers
was to be fashionable, to be known in the highest stratas
of society, and looked upon as the leader of an exclusive
set or coterie, into which many Peris might long to
enter, as one once longed to enter Paradise; but the
inhabitants were more particular as to their associates, and
the gates more rigorously guarded than we hope and trust
are the gates of the Paradise of our future existence.


The other lady was our old friend Ada Lewisham,
now Mrs. Selwynson.


Sir James and Lady Scarth had been in the Isle of
Wight the nreceding autumn, and when there had met
<!-- Leaf 177, Page: 169 -->
Ada and John Selwynson, who were spending their
honeymoon in the island. Sir James and Mr.
Selwynson were old friends, very intimate friends; their wives
met for the first time.


Lady Scarth took rather a fancy to Ada, and,
havingnothing better in view, condescended to accompany Sir
James to Selwyncombe, -where John begged him to
come for the last of the pheasant-shooting in the end of
January. The Scarths, in their turn, invited the
Selwynsons to visit them in the lake country, which they
did.


The spring was a late one; though the beginning of
May, frost still reigned on mountain heights, and it was
voted too cold for mountain expeditions, so an excursion
was planned in Sir James' drag, and Walter Forbes and
his cousin happening to call while the plan was under
discussion, were asked to join it, and told to ask Mrs.
Seymour if she would also do so.


On this day of which we are speaking, Walter was
riding to Scarth Grange to give her answer in the
affirmative; he said it would be better for him to
gothere than to write, as he could discuss arrangements
more fully. On arriving at the Grange, he was graciously
received by Lady Scarth. He glanced round the room,
and saw that only Lady Scarth was there.


\"Tell me quickly what your mother's answer is ?"
she said. " I have been waiting most impatiently to
have it."


\"She will be very pleased to come. Suppose I drive
her and my cousin to meet you at Grasmere ? I think
we shall crowd you."  
  
  
  " Sir James made the plan. I think we can all go
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 170 -->
on the drag; it would be much nicer to be all together,
and you can tell us about everything. The men will
come in to luncheon, so then you can hear all about it!
or, if Mrs. Selwynson likes it, we might go to them—
they are drawing the river above the salmon-house."

\"If the walk will not be farther than you and Mrs
Selwynson hke, I shall find it delightful."


"We can walk there very well. And now, Mr.
Forbes, I want to ask you about your friend Major
Severne—I hear he is a great friend of yours. Have
you seen him lately ?"


\"No, not very lately; I hear from him now and
then."


\"I met him when we were staying at Lady
Wentworth's; he was helping to conduct a mission at C,
and staying in the house with us. We all fell in love
with him, every one of us. Lady Wentworth, Lady
Dashforth, and myself, went about all the back streets
to get people to go to church. We felt quite frightened
sometimes, walking back in the dark late at night. We
would not use the carriages, so that every one might be
alike."


\"How virtuous ! And do you think the mission
made much impression on people ?"


\"It made a very great impression on me. Mr. Giles
was the missionist, and though I talked to him every
day, we talked so little about people and those sort ot
subjects, that I never once found out my old friend Mrs.
Arundel lived in his parish till just the last day by
chance."


\"Please tell me what you did talk about; I should
like to know."
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 171 -->

\"No, no; I cannot quite tell you that; but it would
have done you a great deal of good to talk to Mr. Giles;
because I know you are not quite—quite—quite Is
he, Mrs. Selwynson ?"  
  
  
  Ada entered the room at that moment.


"I do not know; I only heard he was not quite
something."


\"Nor do I know. I am quite in the dark as to what
I am accused of not being quite. Will you explain,
Lady Scarth ?" said Walter, laughing.


\"Not now; we must get our hats. You will like to
come and see the fishing ?" she said to Ada.  
  
  
  " Yes, very much."  
  
  
  As they walked towards the river, Walter began:


\"Will you please finish what you were saying, Lady
Scarth, and satisfy my curiosity to know what
mysterious sins Mr. Gdes would give me absolution for."


\"I did not say he would give you absolution; that
follows repentance, you know. I said you are not quite
—quite what you ought to be, and I should like Mr.
Giles to give you a good talking to. Indeed, if you were
not a friend of Major Severne, I do not know that I could
have anything to do with you."


\"I will readily plead guilty to not bei ng what I ought
to be; but won't you instruct me, instead of giving me
up ? and I should still like to know how you arrived at
your conclusion."


\"That is a secret. Come and see me in London, and
perhaps I may tell you."


The net was just brought to land as our friends came
up to the fishing party.
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 172 -->

Keepers, excited dogs, gentlemen in grey
shootingjackets, a country woman holding a baby, a small boy
gaping at the flapping fish, made a pretty, animated
group, set against purple blue hills and gleaming
water, the interest and beauty of the scene heightened
by accessories of sound and motion, accidents of light
and shade from flying clouds, whispering reeds bending
and bowing like living things, blackbird and thrushes'
thrilling music, and the murmur of a brook rushing to
the river.


Sir James Scarth and John Selwynson came forward
to shake hands with Walter.


"There's a chap you know," said Sir James. "We
met him in Keswick yesterday with his tutor, and as he
was a friend of Selwynson's, I asked them both to come
to luncheon to-day."


Walter, looking round, saw Harry Gresford, who
turned red, and shook hands very quietly.


\"Why, Harry, I did not expect to meet you. You
must come to Scarcalder."


\"No, thank you, I cannot. We go on to Oban
tomorrow, where a lot of fellows join us."  
  
  
  " A reading party. Who is your coach ?"  
  
  
  " Morris; he was a Rugby master."


\"How are all at Berwerton ? how are—your sisters and
Aunt Jane ?"  
  
  
  " Well, thank you; at least, Aunt Jane is ill."


\"Is she ? Mrs. Selwynson did not say so. Is she
alone ?"


\"No—one of my sisters is staying with her. Your
reading-room is come, and is being put up. It was
John Selwynson suggested the portable one being got.
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 173 -->
I think it was a very good idea, because I hope my
father will give some ground for it some day. He
ought to."


\"Mr. Moore sent me a sketch of it. I suppose the
original is very ugly ?"


\"Well, I do not know—not very, and it is so clean
aud fresh. Shall you and Mrs. Seymour come to
Berwerton soon ?"


\"Not permanently. We are to stay on at Scarcalder.
I was at home for a short time not long ago. I mean to
try and come for the opening of the reading-room. Do
you think Severne would come and give us an address ?
You could write to him about it, you know; and I say,
Harry, you wdl look in now and then. Don't leave it
all to the parsons."


Harry's face brightened at Major Severne's name. It
would be jolly if Severne could come.


\"I will go, if you like, sometimes; but I should not
be much good."


\"Oh yes, you would. You are just the fellow. Show
the men you care for them. Talk over things in the
newspapers with them, and speak out your own views about
labour and land. If you have not got any, get some
up. They may prefer their own crude, one-sided,
notions; and in talking to them they always come round
to the point they started from; hut wider views will
work into them by degrees. They have to be taught
very gradually, and can only learn to see very slowly."


\"Suppose I teach them to see wrong ? Besides, I do
not see very well myself."


\"It is better you should not. Always stick to your
Conservatism, interpreting it a little more widely than
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 174 -->
your father would. I don't look ever to see you a Radical.
The fault of half the political agitators and
speechifiers is that, with good intentions, they try to let a flood
of light upon dark ignorance, when they often are only
half-enlightened themselves. They go about shouting
war-cries they don't know the meaning of. The result
is utter misconception, bewilderment, and anarchy,
among the poor people they address and influence.
Since I have been here I have been learning a lot
about peasants. One learns a lot from them also, then
they are more intelligent here than about
Berwerton."


\"What did you think of Forbes when he lived in
your part of the world ?" asked Sir James Scarth of
John Selwynson after dinner.


\"No one saw much of him: he was such a quiet
fellow. He spent all his time writing poems or plays
or something, which were never published. He grew
flowers; he is quite crazy about flowers. He would not
come forward or take any part in anything. Of course,
women all thought him adorable. They always like
those moony chaps. There's one of the prettiest girls
in the county half breaking her heart about him now, I
fear."


\"Ah ! I remember hearing something about his being
engaged to a girl in M shire. His uncle did not hke
it. Why was the engagement broken off ?"


\"I heard his uncle would do nothing for him. He
has nothing of his own but the old house and one or
two fields; yet he was content to live on his mother,
indulging himself in anything he chose, without movin"
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 175 -->
his little finger to get some sort of income to marry on,
though he dangled about after Kate Gresford for two or
three years. At last her father would stand it no longer,
and sent him off."


\"And did Miss Gresford agree to his being sent
off 1"


\"Yes. I believe so; there was some quarrel. I do not
know the rights of it; but she has grown a little pale,
thin thing, while he seems to be making himself very
jolly. Going to marry his cousin, you say ?"


\"Yes; so that old gossip Skidtwaithe told me. Do you
know, about here we think rather well of Walter Forbes.
He manages everything for his uncle."  
  
  
  " Do you mean he manages the estate ?"


\"Yes; and he gets his uncle to do things he would
Jo O
only have stormed about if any one else had suggested
them. Some new cottages are very much wanted, and
young Forbes came over to look at some I have
put up. He looked them all over in the most practical
way, and has since shown me some capital plans
hedrew himself, with an improvement in the ovens and
fuel-shed. You know he was brought up here as a boy,
and was always coming and going, except for a while
when he was not on terms with his uncle. The people
about always liked him; but now, upon my word, they
can't have enough of him. I sometimes think, if he
should take it into his head to oppose me next
election, I should have a hot time of it, though I feel
sure I should win the day."


"Do you think he has any intention of coming
forward ?"  
  
  
  " No, I do not think he has the least wish for public
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 176 -->
life. I believe his heart is still among his books and
his flowers, or with that young woman you talked about.
I imagine it is only for his uncle's sake he stays here,
and comes forward to take his uncle's place at public
meetings, and so on, merely from a sense of duty. He
is going to be made a magistrate next month. I know
he dislikes that very much; but old Forbes won't act,
and while I am in the House I do not expect to have
justice's work to do, although I am obliged to take some
now and then, we are so very badly off for men who
will work."


\"Do you think Forbes has good judgment ? I confess
I rather looked upon him as a man who might fly away
upon crotchets and lose himself."


\"I suspect there is a capability for Quixotism iu
him; but he has not a particle of conceit; in fact, he is
too self-distrustful ever to succeed in the world as a
public man; but I have noticed that he has much
appreciation of character, and that he will listen
attentively to various opinions, and then steer a pretty good
course of his own. He is not above asking advice; as
his uncle's representative, I do not think he will do
anything crotchety."


\"You are quite enthusiastic about him, Jim. What
sort of a man is the uncle ?"


"A good old fellow as ever breathed, but a very
queer one. He was an active man and a good landlord
in an old-fashioned sort of way, always voted dead
against me, you know. After his wife's death he shut
himself up altogether; then he went abroad with his
daughter, and only a strange courier with them. When
lie came back he was in a very bad state—quite broken
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 177 -->
down. They say the daughter never understands her
lather, or finds out when he is ill. Langton, their
doctor, thinks the old squire must have had a slight
stroke of paralysis, without the daughter or the courier
finding it out."


"Did not she send for Mrs. Seymour and
Walter ?"


\"No; Mrs. Seymour met them by chance somewhere,
and sent for her son. Langton says the old squire would
never have got round without him—that Walter is more
of a daughter to him than is the daughter. He has
tact, and is so gentle and tender. He managed to rouse
him from his fits of desponding stupor as no one else
could. Now the old man is better, and goes about a
little, but still depends very much on his nephew, who
does all the writing and head work, and the servants
and bailiff come to him for orders. Between ourselves,
I believe there is something not quite right among
them. Walter's father was a queer, wild chap, quite
without self-control. There was a little girl who was
an idiot; fortunately she died young."


\"I have thought Walter a bit queer now and then.
I think he might get off lus balance."


\"I think I know what you mean. I can imagine the
possibility; I trust and think it is not a probability.
He is a very steady fellow, and has got himself in good
command. He does not drive with a loose rein, like his
father did, never restraining himself in the least; all
the same, I was very fond of poor Algernon Forbes. I
thought him a great hero when I was a boy and he a
young man. He did not marry a cousin, which is
probably all the better for Walter."  
  
  
  12
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 178 -->

\"Yet Walter is to marry his cousin. What a pity it
seems."


\"True, from some points of view it does seem a pity;
but her fifty thousand will be a great lift to him. He
is not cut out for a poor man; if he could make up three
thousand a year and get into Parliament, he would do
something, though he has not self-confidence enough to
make a great man. He is not enough of a
humbugeither; but I would rather see him on our side the
House than opposite."


"Well, we have had a long gossip over our
neighbours' affairs; let us join the ladies."  
  
  
  CHAPTER XIX.  
  
  
  A COACHING TOUR.  
  
  
  The soote season, that bud and blome forth brings,
With grene hath clad the hill and eke the vale."

The coaching expedition came off. Mr. Skidtwaithe
promised to dine with the squire every day, and to
look in upon him frequently while his belongings were
away.


So, on a fine morning, Mrs. Seymour, Walter, and
Sarah drove to Scarth Hall, there ascended Sir James's
drag, drawn by beautifully-matched bays, of whom a
wheeler and a leader were raw hands, young and
playful.


Mrs. Selwynson, from the box seat, viewed the gambols
of these creatures with some trepidation; but Sir James
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 179 -->
■soon reduced them to order. At Keswick all the party
walked about, and bought pencils.


The drive to Grasmere was delightful; there they
were to stay the night. They reached that pretty vale
in the afternoon, and all set forth for a stroll. While
Sarah, with Mrs. Seymour's and Sir James's assistance,
was deciding on a place to sketch, Walter and Ada
wandered into the churehyard.


\"I remember," he said, " you have a taste for
makingpilgrimages; so let us make one to offer devotion at
the tomb of Wordsworth."


A man engaged in mowing the grass in the
churchyard ceased his occupation, and coming to them,
insisted upon conducting them to the poet's tomb, talking
volubly all the time.


Presently a whistle was heard, and the loquacious
clerk or sexton, saying, " That is to tell me that I am
required in my shop," bowed and departed.


Tones of an organ were heard from the interior of the
church. Ada said:  
  
  
  " Let us sit on this wall and listen."


They did so. On the other side of the wall a brook
babbled as it went to the lake, its tones blending
with those of the organ. Helm Crag reigned
majestically over the valley, and " the everlasting hdls"
were around. Calm peace spread over the hearts of
the listeners, and influenced their converse. Walter
quoted:  
  
  
  " All around is fair,
Composed with Nature's finest care,

And in her fondest love :  
  
  
  Peace to embosom, and content
To overawe the turbulent,

The selfish to reprove."  
  
  
  12—2
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 180 -->

"Where is that from?" said Ada. "I know it is
Wordsworth; but in which of his poems ?"


\"It is the ' Wishing Gate.' Do you not remember
it?"


"I have read it, but I cannot now recall it. Tell me
some more, if you can."  
  
  
  He repeated:  
  
  
  " And not in vain, when thoughts are cast
Upon the irrevocable past.

Some penitent sincere
May for a worthier future sigh,
While trickles from his downcast eye

No unavailing tear.  
  
  
  il The sage who feels how blind, how weak
Is man, though loth such help to seek,

Yet passing here might pause,
And thirst for insight to allay
Misgiving, while the crimson day

In quietness withdraws."


There was a short pause, which was broken by
Ada:


\"Mr. Forbes," she said, " Sir James has told me so
much about you, and about all you do, and are trying
to do, and I want to tell you how very much I respect
you for it, and so does my husband."


\"I do not understand. Sir James has overrated
something. My uncle likes me to be with him, and it
would be the basest ingratitude not to stay with him if
I am of use. I am only doing what any ordinary land
agent would do much better, only my uncle dislikes
having one—in fact, he would not have one."


"Exactly. And you have given up habits of life
that were, I think, very dear to you, to take a position
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 181 -->
no one but you could fill. You sacrificed yourself not
only for the good of your uncle, but for the good of the
community, and—it was a great thing to do."


\"Thank you for understanding it was a sacrifice. I
believe most people think me a lucky fellow; but alas !
instead of doing great things, I make perpetual blunders
about small things, and perhaps I am not quite as
disinterested as I seem. Berwerton has ceased to be
the same to me as formerly. Will you,
nevertheless, retract an accusation you once brought against
me."  
  
  
  "What was it?"


\"That I had built a palace for myself to live in, and
scorned others."


\"Did I say that ? I think I was very impertinent.
I do retract it most thoroughly. To my mind none
could lead a more useful, unselfish life than you do.
In the knowledge that you are not thinking about
doing, but doing, I think you will become reconcded to
the life you have chosen."


"I am reconciled, and in having obtained your
approval, I am more than reconciled. Be my ' wishing
gate,' if I look back upon the ' irrevocable past' and feel
that it has been wasted. Wish with me that I may
obtain ' a worthier future.'"


\"I wdl," she said. " I will wish you to have of the
best life can offer, and before the day of life ends, may
you have ' insight to allay misgiving.'"  
  
  
  Walter held out his hand.


\"Thank you. You will be my friend ? We may
always be friends, may we not ?"  
  
  
  " Yes," said Ada, " we may always be friends."
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 182 -->

Rising, they joined the others. Mrs. Seymour and
Sir James were pacing up and down, while Sarah
sketched. Mrs. Seymour was not looking quite pleased.


Walter saw a shawl lying by his cousin. Picking it
up, he placed it carefully over her shoulders.

\"You are not to catch cold, child," he said.


\"Quite right," said his mother. " It is getting very
chilly. Shall we go to the hotel, Mrs. Selwynson ?"


Lady Scarth and John now came up. On this
lady's countenance also, were indications that the
weather was rather stormy.


"If you like bears, Jim," she whispered to her
husband, " I wish to goodness you would keep them for
your own private entertainment." And as Selwynson
moved away with his wife and Walter's mother, she
continued: " That man can talk of nothing but his own
wife, and poor's-rates!"


"Poor's-rates!" said Sir James. "What could he
find to say about poor's-rates ?"


\"They are less, or larger, or something, than where
he lives. You do not suppose I listened, do you ?"


\"My dear," quoth her husband, " are you not mistaken
in calling him a bear ? You seem to have found him a
bore."


Without the smallest indication of having heard the
remark, Lady Scarth turned upon Sarah.


\"I did not know you sketched, Miss Forbes. I
dare say it is a pleasure to yourself; but in this sort
of party it really breaks it up, and disjoints it
sadly if some one is always wanting to sit down and
sketch."  
  
  
  Walter watched the colour come into his cousin's
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 183 -->
face; she bit her lips, dashed the wrong colour into her
sketch, saw she was spoiling it, threw away her painting
water, and prepared to rise. Walter came to the rescue:


\"Go on, please, Sarah. I alone am to blame, Lady
Scarth. I particularly wanted a sketch in Grasmere.
Indeed, I fear I shall exhaust your and my cousin's
patience by exacting many sketches from her before our
tour is ended. I will get you some more water, Sarah.
There is yet an hour before dinner-time. Let me take
you for a row on the lake, Lady Scarth ? Sir James,
will you come?"


\"No, I will keep guard over Sarah; and I think she
will acknowledge that I oucffit to have the sketch
instead of you; anyhow, I shall try to convince her that
is the case!"


\"That wdl be mean of you, Sir James; for I think
Sarah must admit I have earned it.—You will not be
afraid of catching cold on the lake ?" Walter said,
turning to Lady Scarth.


\"Oh, no! I am not afraid. The people who are
always wrapping up, catch cold soonest," she replied,
glancing at Sarah's shawl.  
  
  
  At dinner all seemed in the best of spirits.


\"Grasmere is charming," said Lady Scarth. " What
you people were all about not to go on the lake I
cannot think. But of this I am convinced: no one can
know anything of the beauties of Grasmere if they have
not been on the lake. Can they, Mr. Forbes ?"


The team of beautiful bays was drawn up at the hotel
door next morning, waiting to convey our travellers on
their farther way.
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 184 -->

Sir James, whip in hand, stood looking critically at
the horses whde waiting for the ladies, who were not
ready.


"You mean to take them to London, do you not,
Jim ?" said John Selwynson.


\"Yes, if they will settle down to work well together,
and I think they will, I shall put them in the rail at
Keswick, on our return: by that time I shall know
pretty well what they are made of."  
  
  
  " If looks were all, I don't think a prettier lot could  
  
  
  be found; but the near leader will never step up to her

companion."


\"She can step very well if she likes it, but I put her
on the curb at starting yesterday, and the little lady
didn^t hke it. You'll see she will go kindly enough, as
I have her to-day on the check."


\"He's cut his fetlock a bit. A wheeler brushing like
that is not very safe," said John, pointing to the near
wheeler.


\"He is all right to-day. The confounded blacksmith
did not take the edge off his shoe; I gave special
orders about it, too. He brushed coming down Dunmail
Raise."  
  
  
  The rest of the party now appeared.


\"Our programme for to-day," said the coachman, as
he mounted his box, "is to go to Ambleside; from
thence to Windermere, where, after we have crossed the
ferry, a carriage will meet us and take us to Coniston;
we shall then return to Windermere, and I shall drive
you to Lowood, where we stay the night. I want my
horses to have a quiet day; I must not over-task the
young ones."
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 185 -->
  
 , His wife said :


\"I should have thought that the horses could do as
much as we could; it seems to me, that we are to work
harder than they."


The remark struck all as being unanswerable; ho
one appeared prepared to dispute the position, till Sir
James, unwilling to let his horses rest under the
imputation of not working as hard as his wife, said :


\"Why, my dear, you work under such different
conditions : they draw, and you are drawn; besides, I
didn't know you were working at all."


\"I said they did not do as much as we did. We are
doing something all day long; when they do not draw,
they are resting or eating."


The next day the horses could hardly be said to do
nothing, since they were required to pull the coach
through Kirkston Pass. The people, however, kept up
the competition, and did much also, for they walked to
the top of the pass; even the ladies did so, with the
exception of Lady Scarth and Mrs. Seymour.


As they walked up the hill, Sarah said to
Walter:  
  
  
  " Shall you not be glad when this tour is over ?"


\"No; I am enjoying it very much. Are not you ?"
he asked.


\"I hke seeing'the country, but I should like it much
better if there were only you and I. I have
hardlybeen able to speak three words to you since we started.
I wonder how old daddy's getting on?"


\"I had a note from Skidtwaithe this morning. He
says all is going on well, and Uncle James is pretty
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 186 -->
cheerful. He and Skidtwaithe rode to Musgrave's
yesterday morning and bought a cow. You must try to
get another sketch in Patterdale."


\"Yes, if you will help me to choose a place, and will
keep off Lady Scarth."


"Of course I will; but you needn't get so angry when
she says little ill-natured things; they mean nothing;
she would not say them if she was not cross."


\"It is not good manners. I do not Hke her. Do
you ?"  
  
  
  " Yes, I do; she amuses me, and is pretty."


\"I suppose that is quite what you wish ?" said Lady
Scarth to Mrs. Seymour, looking back at the walking
party from the top of the drag, and somehow indicating
that she aUuded to Sarah and Walter Forbes; " is he
very devoted to her ?"


\"Yes—I think so; she is a dear, affectionate girl,
and will soon get more manner, and improve very
much."  
  
  
  " She is certainly very shy and quiet now."


\"It is the greatest misfortune for a girl to lose her
mother just when she should be taken into society.
Sarah's manners are young because she has never been
much among people since she left the schoolroom. Her
shyness will soon shake off; she is very clever and
accomplished."  
  
  
  "A little bit of a blue-stocking, is she not ?"


\"No, indeed. She likes reading for an occupation.
She and Walter like reading the same books; they can
talk them over together. It is most fortunate they care
for the same pursuits."  
  
  
  " Mrs. Seymour," said the coachman, turning round
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 187 -->
\"do you know what house we shall see at the head of
the pass ?"


\"Yes," said Mrs. Seymour unwarily; " the highest
hinhabited house—I mean, the highest—inhabited—
house in England. It is very difficult to say."  
  
  
  Sir James laughed.


\"Dick!" he called out to one of the grooms; " you
are a Patterdale man. Is there a house at the top of
this place ? It must be very cold there."


\"Yes, Sir James; if you please, there is a house at
the top of the pass, and it's the 'ighest in'abited house
in England."


\"Mr. Forbes" said Mrs. Selwynson, coming to Walter's
side, " you have not asked me much about your friends
in Berwerton."


\"No. I asked Harry Gresford, and was sorry to hear
Aunt Jane is not well; but I hope there is not much
amiss, nothing to render you uneasy ?"


\"I am rather anxious; I did not have a good account
this morning."


\"I am sorry. Did you hear from—Miss Gresford ?
Harry said she was staying with your aunt."


\"Yes; I heard from Kate Gresford. It is such a
comfort to me that she can go to stay with Aunt Jane;
and I think the change does her good also."  
  
  
  " I am sure it must," Walter replied, rather absently.


Mrs. Selwynson believed that she had found out all
she wished to know, namely, that Walter no longer took
much interest in Kate Gresford.


\"Miss Forbes," said John Selwynson, " you are a
botanist: will you tell me the name of this flower?"
And he held out a small pale pink blossom.
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 188 -->

\"It is Pinguicula lusitanica. I am so glad you
have found it. Is there any more ?"


\"Yes, a good deal. Come and see the place it grows
in; there is plenty of time; Sir James will stop a quarter
of an hour at the top of the pass."


\"Ask him if he knows what house is at the head of
the pass," said Walter.


\"Yes, I know; the 'ighest hinhabited house in
England," answered John.  
  
  
  Sarah laughed. Mr. Selwynson did not see why.


\"Do you remember once telling me you should like
to see a place where no man had trod or left vestiges of
having trod ?" asked Walter of Ada, as the others went
to the roadside bog to look for the flower.


\"I do remember our having some conversation about
it."


\"There are many places among these hills where
there is no apparent record of man having visited them,
places that are so closed in with rocks that all sight of
surrounding civilisation, even of rude stone walls, is shut
out; in such places I have thought of you. Once I was on
such a spot, musing in a granddoquent strain about
being alone with nature in her untamed strength, and
trying to imagine that no human foot had pressed that
mountain sod before, when a something white on the
ground caught my eye. White specks of snow were
still here and there on the mountains, but this was—
not—a—speck—of snow "  
  
  
  " What was it ?"


\"I went close to examine—I touched it with my
stick—it was "  
  
  
  " Oh do tell me. Something- dreadful—a skeleton V
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 189 -->

"A man's paper collar, that had actually survived
the winter. It had probably been rejected from some
tourist's knapsack last autumn, when our hills are
turned into a playground for Manchester clerks."  
  
  
  " It must have given your feelings rather a shock."


\"It did; a shock I shall not soon get over. In future,
when I am trying to attain to elevation of feeling,
when I have nearly succeeded, all will be spoilt by an
unpleasant, uneasy dread that I shall soon meet with a
man's paper collar."


\"I am very sorry for you; I do not know that I have
ever felt more sorry," said Ada, laughing. " When
hordes of tourists invade your territory, I wonder if
yrou feel most hke the Romans when invaded by
barbarians, or like savages invaded by civilised Romans."


\"That is an invidious remark. We will not call
ourselves Romans or savages. In truth—though it is a
great bore to have to write' up ' private' on all the
gates—we receive our invaders very joyfully; all the
country people and all the townsmen look forward to
the time when ' the company' wdl come, ensuring a
ready sale for all sorts of farm and garden produce, and
plenty of employment for every one."


111 can understand that the lower orders may like to
reap a harvest from tourists, but surely to you and the
Scarths, and other people, the incursion must be a great
nuisance ?"


"You will think me very mercenary, but since my
vocation has led me to go among the farmers and
cottagers a good deal, I cannot help being influenced by
their feelings; to them a bad season, by which they
mean a decrease in the average influx of visitors, is of as
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 190 -->
much consequence as a bad season of crops, and you
know what affects tenants affects landlords in no slight

degree."

\"Mr. Forbes, I now believe in your thoroughconversion to a practical business-like man."


Walter smded a little sadly. " I fear I am not got
very practical or business-like; it is human nature to
be led by popular opinion. I do not now regret that
fate has forced me into a position in which I must of
necessity consider the bearings of things from other
points of view than formerly. I felt quite pleased the
•other day at seeing a load of the first excursionists pass
by, because I knew an old woman would probably be
able to sell a large gathering of eggs she possessed at
the inn, without having to take them some miles to
market. If I ever return to my dear old home, I shall
be none the worse for having learnt wider views of
people and things."


\"You mean to come back to us some day then ? Do
you not care for this country ?"


\"Indeed I do, I love every hdl-top and every flower.
It is my native land, but I was always brought up not
to think of it as an abiding place, and though I had not
been there very long, I had learned to love Berwerton
■dearly; it is my own little corner of the world, where
I hope to find rest in my old age, and where I may
■carry on pursuits I am very fond of."  
  
  
  Where you may be  
  
  
  " A poet hidden

In the light of thought,

Singing hymns unbidden

Till the world is wrought
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not."
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 191 -->
  
  Walter blushed crimson.


Ada had met with the lines she quoted in a book or
review. They had struck her fancy partly because she
had found in them something applicable to Walter;
they had remained in her memory; she now repeated
them almost carelessly—they chanced to recur to her
mind, and seemed suitable. Her companion glanced at
her, and could not command his voice to speak; it
seemed that in some wonderful way she divined, and
perhaps sympathised with, aspirations the presumption
of which he acknowledged. In his younger days at
Oxford he had repeated those lines to himself over and
over—perhaps they had iufluenced him more than he
knew; now, to hear them from the lips of Ada Selwynson,
and applied to himself, affected him strongly; he wrestled
with some wave of feeling, and there was silence.


It was broken by Sarah coming up breathless. " Look,
Walter, are they not fine specimens; they are out earlier
than usual ?" and she held out to him some Pinguicula
flowers.


\"Give me your arm, John," said his wife, " it is a
severer climb up this hill than I expected."


Sir James had descended from his coach box, while his
panting horses stood at ease at the top of the pass; he
came to meet the others of his party. " Miss Forbes,"
he said, " do you know why this house is quite
celebrated ?"


\"It is the highest inhabited house, in England," said
Sarah.  
  
  
  " Ah, you've been put up to it," said the baronet,


The descent of the pass was successfully made, and
the wheeler did not brush, having had his shoes made
to his mind.
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 192 -->

In the evening our friends enjoyed themselves rowing
upon the beautiful Ullswater. Sir James Scarth, M.P.,
some time bow oar of his college boat, actually
distinguished himself catching a crab.


Walter undertook to guide John up Helvellyn to see
the sun rise next morning, which feat they accomplished.
From Ullswater they went to Penrith and visited the
castle, from thence returning to Keswick. As they neared
the town of lead pencils the coachman was
overwhelmed with thanks and congratulations upon the
very successful way in which he and his team had
acquitted themselves. The latter were declared to
have improved incredibly under his tuition, and there
could now be no question but that their appearance in
Hyde Park would excite both envy and admiration in
the minds of many.


The coachman thanked his friends for the kind way
in which they expressed themselves regarding himself
and his horses. He heard that some of them were
likely to be in London before long, when he hoped he
should meet them again, and they would let him drive
them to Richmond, which would give him great
pleasure.


On reaching Keswick, all separated with mutual
regret. The Selwynsons went south, whde the Scarths,
Mrs. Seymour, Walter and Sarah Forbes returned to
their north-country homes.

  CHAPTER XX.  
  
  
  VANITY FAIR.  
  
  
  " The course of human life is changeful still,
As in the fickle mind and wandering rill;
Or like the light dance which the wild breeze weaves
Amidst the faded race of fallen leaves;
Which now its breath bears down, now tosses high,
Beats to the earth, or wafts to middle sky;

Such and so varied the precarious play

Of fate with man, frail tenant of a day."
Anonymous.

Great London was very full; the season was at its height.
Carriages drawn by proud, high-stepping horses, and
filled with tastefully dressed occupants, thronged the
streets and parks. At some periods of the day every
one of those green chairs were occupied that, when
unoccupied, look so numerous and forlorn in the park.
Pass at what time you would through the western and
south-western districts, strings of carriages standing
before many doors told that many entertainments were
in progress : at breakfasts, luncheons, teas, dinners, " at
homes," gay pleasure-seekers were meeting, for social
converse and amusement.


Pomp, wealth, power, beauty, and talent, all
combined, strove to render the attractions of the greatest
capital in the world as attractive as possible; and they
succeeded.


What city, not excepting Paris, can offer such variety
of delights, such charming resources, gratifying all tastes,
to every one in a position to avad themselves of those
resources, as our own big London ? On the surface, how
brioht how fair, how pleasant all appears; and much,
footnote:[Possible signature: "13"]
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 194 -->
very much, is really bright, and fair, and pleasant.
Then comes the stratum where much that is good is
intimately mixed with bad, and much that is bad has
minglings of good; and, though through the whole there
may be an undercurrent, not too palpably visible to the
casual observer, of those bad things St. Paul tells us we
had better put away from us, as evil-speaking, lying,
etc, perhaps some of us have rather outgrown
consideration for the advice of St. Paul in more things than in
these.


A gentleman coming out of a large publisher's
premises in Piccadilly was arrested at the sight of a
carriage drawn up. at a door two numbers lower down.
It seemed for a moment as if he wished to avoid
recognition by the occupants of the carriage, but perceiving
himself noticed, he came up and shook hands with Lady
Scarth.


\"So you are in London, and have not been to see
me," she said.


\"We only came up two days ago. I meant to call on
you to-morrow."


\"I shall have to move on directly. Get in and tell
me everything. Who are ' we' ?"


Walter got into the carriage, and explained that "we"
meant his uncle, cousin, mother, and himself; they were
staying at an hotel in Bond Street.


\"You have really got your poor, old, uncle to come
up ?—that must tie you all very much."

\"Not more than we like to be tied; he is not so well,
nd we wanted him to see London doctors."


Here the footman, who had been waiting for something
in the shop, appeared, and stood expectant of orders.
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 195 -->
  
  Referring to a list, Lady Scarth said:


\"I am now going to see about places for the opera.
•Can I put you down anywhere ?"


\"Thank you. Perhaps you would put me down at
Burlington House. I am going there, for a quiet
hour, while people are at their luncheons; I am told
Ferguson has got his picture hung, and I want to
see it."


\"I can stop at the Academy very well, it is on my
way. You must be quite astonished to see me out so
early."


\"I am. I could hardly believe the evidence of my
eyes. What could have produced such a
phenomenon?"


\"I had some very important things to do, and Jim
wants the horses this afternoon; it is really very
tiresome for me that we have only the drag horses and one
other in London, so that if Jim wants the drag I cannot
go out, though certainly it is not very often he does
want it. By-the-bye, we are going to Hurlingham this
afternoon; will you come with us ? There is room in
the drag. You wdl meet your friends the Selwynsons."


\"Thank you. I have promised to go to Kew Gardens
with my mother and cousin this afternoon."


\"You can go to Kew any day, or they can go there
just as well without you."


\"You are very kind. I do not know what my
mother's engagements are. May I send you a note in
the course of an hour if I can come ?"


\"Very well, do so, It is just possible when I return
home I may find Sir James has filled up the place; if
so, I will let you know."  
  
  
  13—2
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 196 -->

Walter Forbes was very fond of seeing gardens; he
really wished to see the laying out of those at Kew,
where he had not been. Neither had he ever been to
Hurlingham; its delights- were not in his line—they
were not attractions, but rather repulsed him. He
believed it to be a place where heartless fashionable
women and heartless fashionable men idled away hours
in frivolous conversation, a desire to witness sports
involving much animal torture serving as an ostensible
excuse for the meeting of the gay throng.


He walked through the rooms at Burlington House,
unable to give full attention to a critical examination of
the pictures; he was vexed with himself, and vexed at
being vexed. It was true he had himself proposed the
expedition to Kew, but he did not know Lady Scarth
would ask him to go on the drag. Hurlingham he
should not care for; but he liked to see everything for
once. He should be glad to see Sir James and Lady
Scarth. He wanted to ask the former to give him an
order for the House—there was a debate coming on he
wished to hear; and he should be very glad to meet
Mrs. Selwynson. She was a dear friend, and he hoped
never to give up his friendship for her. And yet Sarah
had talked much of the pleasures of the day they were
to spend at Kew, and her old father was perhaps
coming. And Walter, after a bare half-hour among the
pictures, returned to his hotel still in a state of
indecision, but was decided by finding his mother quite willing
to give up the plan for the afternoon, and go to a tea she
had a card for, taking Sarah with her.


At four o'clock Walter found himself at the top of
Sir James Scarth's drag, witnessing a hotly-contested
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 197 -->
game at polo between the officers of two crack
regiments. The combatants were mounted on beautiful
well-bred ponies. These little animals got their legs
hit, were severely spurred, and had their mouths pulled
about a good deal. The horsemanship of the riders
gained the admiration of the assembled throng, the
gazers and gazed-at were alike interested, excited, and
amused; the ponies also shared in the excitement, and
also in the admiration. We will hope it repaid them
for the unpleasant casualties of the combat to the same
degree it did their masters.


While contemplating the game of hockey, the ears of
the gady-dressed multitude lining in -close rows the
boundary of the battle-field were assailed by the sound
of perpetual firing. It was caused by the practise of
a favourite amusement iii vogue at Hurlingham. In
another part of the grounds people were pleasing
themselves by shooting at tame pigeons, which were caught
and put in traps, out of which they were let in order
that men might shoot at them as they new up; those
men who shot most became quite celebrated.


Our friends were all too humane to desire to witness
this spectacle—both Sir James and John Selwynson
condemned it severely.


When the game at polo was ended, the party on the
drag descended and went to tea, which was laid out in
the pretty garden; the tea the Hurlingham Club provide
for their friends is of the very best, and so are the cream
and strawberries. Our friends pronounced all good, and
having regaled themselves, wandered about in the
charming grounds.  
  
  
  Lady Scarth met with many acquaintances, and so
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 198 -->
did Sir James. While they were speaking to their
respective friends, Walter found himself walking with
Mrs. Selwynson in a pleasant walk under shady trees
by the side of the broad river Thames.


Walter did not find intercourse with his companion
as pleasurable as it usually was to him. She did not
attend to what he said; she seemed ill at ease; she
wanted to know who all the people who spoke to Lady
Scarth were; she rather emphatically spoke of Lord and
Lady P, with whom she and John were going to'
dine. She took some little trouble to make Walter
understand how very many invitations she and John had
been obliged to refuse because of prior ones. She seemed
quite cross when asked how Aunt Jane was, and scouted
the idea of her being ill. Ada was inclined to imitate
Lady Scarth in the pursuit of fashion and pleasures; to
gain ground in this pursuit, she submitted to be
patronised by and was even slightly, very slightly servde to the
baronet's exacting little wife, who liked the homage, and
repaid it by introducing the Selwynsons to a few people,
and getting them invitation cards for some
entertainments. Poor John Selwynson was dragged to evening
parties when he would much rather have gone to a
theatre or had some " kind of a lark:" than gone among
\"swells he did not know."


As they drove back to London, Lady Selwynson asked
John and Ada to dine with her one day in the ensuing
week; they accepted. She then asked Walter to dine the
same day; he declined, pleading a prior engagement.
This refusal evidently vexed Lady Scarth; she tried to
make our hero reverse his decision. Mrs. Selwynson
also expressed disappointment that he could not come,
<!-- Leaf 207, Page: 199 -->
aud at last Walter seemed inclined to waver, when Sir
James interfered. " I do not like people persuaded to
break engagements; I will not have you, Forbes," he
said; " if you have promised to dine out with your
mother and cousin, you had better keep to it."


\"It is the greatest bore," explained Lady Scarth
afterwards, to a bosom friend. " I asked them because
I thought he would be sUre to come to meet them; they
are his great friends, you know, but I did not want the
Selwynsons by themselves; he is a bear, and stands in
a corner all evening; she is all very wed, but absurd,
you know; she dresses up to her eyes, and always looks
as if she had never been out of the country before, in
my opinion; though people do admire her, they hardly
know any one. He was at school with Sir James, and
then his brother officer, so we try to do what we can
for them."


The night after the expedition to Hurlingham, Walter
Forbes sat up long and late, reflecting, and his reflections
were not pleasant, for tears stood in his eyes more than
once. He moralised philosophically upon the difference
of all things, and people seen under different aspects and
acted upon by various influences; she who had seemed
to him so wise, so thoughtful, so charming, as he had
seen her in her rose garden, in the society of her aunt,
one of the party at Aix, and when he had conversed
with her at Wordsworth's grave, was now apparently
changed; he said it was only her surroundings and
background that were changed, but nevertheless the
halo had faded—it was visible that the beautiful idol
was modelled in clay.  
  
  
  Somehow, married life had not seemed to bring out
<!-- Leaf 208, Page: 200 -->
better qualities in Ada, but rather to obscure those she
previously possessed; it might be that the desire she
evinced to rush into gaiety arose from a wish to drown
in excitement the sense of a void, a consciousness that
she had not found in close companionship with her
husband all the fulness of congenial friendship a bride
hopes for. Still, could she have been free to act her hfe
over again, she would not have ordered it differently;
indeed, I think she would have given her hand to her
present lord, more unhesitatingly than before, for she
had learnt to prize the advantages of wealth far more
highly than formerly, and a rich, kind, indulgent
husband dispensed wealth to her with a liberal hand.


Even during the coaching tour, incidents had
happened that a little startled, a little disenchanted Walter,
and the day at Hurlingham had gone far to complete
the disenchantment—not because he found faults in his
ideal: he could have made allowances and found excuses
for faults; it was because, in several instances, minor
actions, unimportant words, and the tone in which words
were uttered, had jarred upon his feelings and run
counter to his taste, scales had fallen from his eyes,
leaving sense of a regret, and something of a discontent
with life and all relating to the labours and pleasures of
life.


In such a mood Walter came down to breakfast next
morning, and found his mother in a ruffled frame of
mind.


She said: " Here is a letter from Maude Gresford; she
writes about Jane, who was our housemaid. She says,
in the end of her letter: ' Mrs. Selwynson cannot be
aware of how critical a state Aunt Jane is. in, or I think
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 201 -->
she would come to see her. Kate is still with her, and
likes to he with her, but I wish she had some one to
share the responsibility with; she is not strong enough to
bear anxiety without it doing her harm; also, Aunt Jane
is often asking when Ada and John Selwynson are likely
to leave London, although she will not let them be sent
for.' I call it shocking and unfeeling of Ada Selwynson
to be going about everywhere when her aunt is in that
state," remarked Mrs. Seymour.


"' That state' is so indefinite. Probably no one has
told Mrs. Selwynson that her aunt is wishing for her,
and she cannot understand ' that state' without being
told about it," said Walter.


\"She does not choose to understand. I am surprised
Mr. Selwynson does not insist upon her going down.
I am sure he does not want to stay here. He looked
very bored at Lady Dashforth's yesterday. By-the-bye,
did I tell you Major Severne is in London ? Wed, you
are not suggesting what I had better do. How tiresome
you are, Walter."


\"Do you not think you had better take Maude's letter
to Mrs. Selwynson ?"


\"I really do not know what to do. I promised to
walk with your uncle this morning, and of course there
is no chance of finding Ada in the afternoon. I do
not like to write; she will perhaps think I have no
right to meddle."


\"I will walk with my father," said Sarah, who had
been in the room during the last part of the
conversation.


\"But you settled to go to Burlington House with
Miss Brown, my dear," demurred Mrs. Seymour.
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 202 -->

\"I must send and stop Miss Brown from coming for
me. She will not mind."


"Yes, Sarah," said Walter, "that will be the best
plan. I will go with you to Mrs. Selwynson's lodgings,
mother, and you can find your own way back in a cab;
I have an appointment in that direction."  
  
  
  And this plan was agreed to.


"Well," said Mrs. Seymour, again meeting her son
in the evening, " I did something. Mr. Selwynson was
at home, so I showed him the letter, and he was much
obhged to me for bringing it. Ada had heard this
morning from her aunt's maid, but is not going down;
but Mr. Selwynson said he should go this afternoon,
and send for Ada if needful."  
  
  
  " Did you see Mrs. Selwynson at all ?"


\"No. It seems she was gone to her dressmaker's.
She spends her mornings there, I expect. At Lady
Dashforth's luncheon-party yesterday she was most
splendid."


"Mother, we have no engagement for to-morrow
evening, have we ?"


\"Sarah and I have none. You said you were going
to some literary dinner."


\"True; Mr. Swinton's. I think I shall not go; and
perhaps I shad run down to Berwerton to-morrow
morning. I shall be back to go with you and Sarah to
the opera the next day."  
  
  
  Mrs. Seymour looked put out.


"What can be the use of your going, Walter? you
would be of no use. If Mr. Selwynson goes, that is
everything; unless Ada would go. You were so pleased
to be asked to Mr. Swinton's. Really, I think you had
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 203 -->
better stay here, particularly as we are all going there
directly."


\"To-morrow is a free day, and I want to see how the
reading-room looks. I always intended to go the first
free day; I want to look after a lot of things. Suppose
you come also."  
  
  
  Mrs. Seymour looked mollified.


\"Certainly, if I went I could give orders about
preparing for us all next month; but no; Francois will do*
it as well if he goes down a day or two previously.
Indeed, Walter, I do not see why you go; it is only ten
days till we aU go."  
  
  
  CHAPTER XXI.  
  
  
  THE SHADOW OF DEATH.  
  
  
  " In vain the sage with retrospective eye,
Would from the what conclude the why,
Infer the motive from the deed, and show
That what we chanced was what we meant to do."

Nevertheless, Walter did go. The next day to
theone last spoken of, he found himself walking among
his roses, which were flowering luxuriantly and wildly,
betraying that little care had been given to pruning
them in the early spring. The garden was not quite
neglected, but roughly cared for under the supervision
of a nurseryman with whom some arrangement had
been made about the vegetables and fruit.


Walter visited every tree, while he turned over in his
mind the question as to whether he would go and ask
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 204 -->
how Aunt Jane was, that evening or not. Leaving the
matter still open, he entered his library, and looked
lovingly along the shelves, once so well filled with
friendly volumes, but now with many gaps in the rows
of books, owing to many having been taken to
Cumberland. These gaps vexed Walter. Soon after
reviewing the books, he found himself walking down
the lane towards Miss Lewisham's garden entrance,
still undecided if he would go to her house. Having
reached the wicket, he paused, leant over it for a minute
or two, then entered. He paused again among the roses
he and Ada had once pruned together; hke his owd,
they told that the hand that would have pruned them
at the right season had been away. A gardener's impulse
led him to take out his knife and cut away one or
two of the long shoots growing from the roots of the
rose stocks. As he was so employed, he heard a man's
step coming down the walk. It was old Thompson.
He started as he saw Walter.


\"Why, Mr. Forbes, sir, I did not know as you were
expected."


\"I came unexpectedly. How do you do, Thompson ?
How is Miss Lewisham ?"


\"She is better, thank you, sir. She took a turn
yesterday. Mr. John's coming seemed to do her good
and give her heart like. If you could come to-morrow,
sir, I think she'd very likely see you. Miss Kate is
sitting out by the drawing-room window. Perhaps,
she would like to see you, sir."


\"I will not disturb her now. I was just coming up
to ask you about Miss Lewisham. I'll call to-morrow."  
  
  
  "Don't ring the door-bell, please, sir. If I do not
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 205 -->
see you coming, just step in. It startles missus when
she hears a bed."


Walter came the next day. The door was opened
for him by Thompson, who said with a smile that Miss
Kate had seen him coining, and that she was gone to
tell Miss Lewisham.


Walter was shown into the drawing-room to await
Kate's reappearance; the room looked the same as of
yore; the furniture and ornaments had the same fixed
aspect, the same air of asserting that they were in their
places, and must not be moved. Half unconsciously,
Walter looked about him for some evidence of Kate
having inhabited the room; he found none. He sighed,
and thought:


\"I suppose she sits in Ada's room. Poor child I
How dreary it must be for her here !"


Shortly afterwards the door opened; a small, pale
girl entered, and shook hands with Walter very calmly,
saying:


\"It was really good of you to come, Mr. Forbes;
Aunt Jane will be much pleased to see you."


Walter Forbes was shocked! Could this pale, thin
creature be the once brilliant beauty, Kate ? For a
moment he could hardly command himself to speak,
bowed stiffly, turned to the window, muttered rather
than uttered: "lam glad she is better;" and silently
followed, as Kate led the way to Aunt Jane's room.


Aunt Jane was sitting in an arm-chair, attired in
shawls and loose wraps. She held out her hand to her
guest tremulously, and tremulously said:  
  
  
  " I do not like receiving you in this way, my dear
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 206 -->
boy; indeed, I think it is quite improper having
gentlemen in my dressing-room, but I am getting used to it."


\"Getting used to being improper, Aunt Jane ? I am
quite shocked at you," said Walter, glad to hide
emotion under the semblance of a joke.


"John has been here twice; there was some business
I had to talk to him about; 1 was very glad he came.
You must not look at me much, because I have only
got my dressing-gown on; I am not properly dressed to
receive company."


\"I wdl sit behind the curtains;" and Walter pulled a
curtain before his face for a moment, and let it fall.


\"You have seen my dear Ada lately, but to be sure,
her husband has been here and told me about her. He
said she was well, and looking forward to seeing me
soon, he said. That was civility, I suppose; he thought
he ought to say so; but I don't know—I don't know."


The latter words were spoken in a low tone, half to
herself.


\"Mrs. Selwynson means to leave London in about a
fortnight, I think; but no doubt she would come sooner
if you asked her."


\"No, no, I won't have her sent for and made to think
I am worse than I am. Of course, it may be that things
may turn out so that she must come, poor thing; but we
shall see. Telegraph—you could telegraph if it 'was
a necessity. Nasty things ! they frighten one out of all
one's senses. I am better now, they say, and John is gone
back to his wife, as he ought to do."


\"What are you reading, Aunt Jane ?" -said Walter,
taking up a book. " Ah! ' Old Kensington;' it is a
charming story."
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 207 -->

\"Yes, it is very well. Dear Kate is reading it to
me. I cannot read for myself; my eyes will not permit
me."  
  
  
  " May I come and read to you ?"


\"You ! I should not like to trouble you. I could
not have you sitting up here. Besides, my woman can
read to me. I have her sometimes. She stumbles over
the hard words a little, but she reads pretty well."


\"I am very fond of reading. Let me come while Miss
Gresford is out walking this afternoon. I shall esteem it
a great honour."


\"Well, it is very kind of you; but yrou must not
mind if, when you come, I am not able to see you. Most
likely I shall be too ill then."


\"How do you really think her ?" Walter asked of
Kate, as he met her on the staircase, after he had taken
leave of Miss Lewisham.


\"She is very weak. A little thing would make her ill
again. Dr. Spencer says she is certainly better, and he
thinks she wdl go on well. He told Mr. Selwynson he
might go back to London, and he is gone back."


\"I know. I wish he had stayed a little longer. It
would have relieved you. Miss Lewisham says I may
come and read to her this evening. How much reading
can she bear ?"


\"She will probably go to sleep in ten minutes, and
you must sit still tdl she awakes. Anson will be in the
next room. You can call her if you want anything."


\"You have not been out much lately, I am sure.
Wdl you go and see Maude, while I am here, and let her
drive you back ?"  
  
  
  " Perhaps I will."
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 208 -->

Walter spoke in the most prosaic, unsympathetic tone
he could command, and Kate replied in like tones; and
yet her little pale face and the wistful look in her eyes
haunted him. He was touched by it; it thrilled some
chord the bright and saucy Kate of old had never
thrilled. " How could they all let her over-do herself
so much, nursing Aunt Jane ? Where were Maude's
eyes ? even the squire might have known better."


True to his appointment, Walter presented himself at
Aunt Jane's in the afternoon, and was admitted to her
apartment. She talked a little in a rather rambling,
desultory way, saying how good Kate was to her, and
speaking several times of " my dear Ada."


When Walter began to read she shut her eyes, and in
about a quarter of an hour was evidently dozing.
Lowering his voice by slow degrees, he ceased to speak, and
read to himself for about an hour, when Anson opened
the door very quietly, and motioned that she would take
his place. As she moved across the room, the invalid
awoke, looked about her confusedly, and asked if Miss
Ada had come in, and if luncheon was ready.


\"No, ma'am," said the maid. " Mr. Forbes has been
reading to you, and you've had a little doze. It is not
time for your medicine."


Walter got up and said good-bye, asking if he might
come again at the same time the next day.


\"Yes, my dear boy, you may come; but I cannot be
sure I can see you. Give my kind regards to your
mother," said Aunt Jane.


Anson followed Walter to explain that Miss
Lewisham was always a little confused when she woke up
first, adding: " I am glad you have come, sir, and got
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 209 -->
Miss Kate to go out. It hurts me to see her pale face,
such a help and a comfort as she has been to us all;
but I must not stay talking now."


Walking down the road by which Kate would
probably return, Walter presently descried a grey pony
drawing a low carriage advancing towards him. It
was Squire Gresford, himself driving back his daughter
Kate.


Our friend did not feel particularly inclined at that
moment to meet the squire; but no means of avoiding
the meeting were at hand, so he walked on, and was
heartily greeted.


\"Wed, Forbes, glad to see you. How's your mother ?
How's your uncle ? So you've turned farmer and land
agent, and I don't know what! Well done you; you'll
be a man at last!"


\"We must not stop, papa; Aunt Jane will want
me," Kate said.


\"Poor old lady, she must do without you soon, for 1
want you. I cannot do with only Maude much longer.
Where are you going, Forbes ? I suppose you are only
mooning. Get up behind—Jim can walk—and tell me
about your style of farming. Rum style, I should
think."


Walter got up behind; the squire became occupied
with driving. Kate very quietly and calmly discoursed
upon the weather and other trivial topics till Walter
got out at the gate to his domain, feeling, he didn't
know wiry, a little hurt.


The gruff old squire had watched his child growing
paler, quieter, graver, with a sore heart. He made her  
  
  
  14
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 210 -->
drink port wine and see a doctor; he gave her a new
horse.


"There couldn't be much the matter with her," he
told himself; " perhaps teaching so much at the village
school was bad for her."  
  
  
  CHAPTER XXII.  
  
  
  CONCLUSION.  
  
  
  " Annie of Tharaw, my true love of old,
She is my life, my goods, and my gold;
Annie of Tharaw, her heart once again
To me has surrendered in joy and in pain."
Hoon.

Thomson came to the Manor early next morning to say
that Miss Lewisham was not quite so well, and Miss
Kate had written to apprise Mrs. Selwynson, and had
sent her letter to Morningford to go by the early post.
About the middle of the day Walter heard that she was
better, and would very probably like to see him in the
afternoon. Accordingly, he caded in the afternoon, and
Aunt Jane did wish to see him. He went to her, having
first persuaded Kate to go into the garden for at least a
short time.


Aunt Jane sat up in her arm-chair as on the previous
day. She smiled as Walter came into the room, and said :


\"So you have come to see the old woman, again.
Anson has put me on my best cap to do you honour;"
and raising one feeble hand, she gave her cap a little
pull which brought it over her forehead. " I wish I
eould see you in a more comfortable room."  
  
  
  He assured her the room was very comfortable, and it
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 211 -->
was so kind to receive him at all. Something
indescribable in Aunt Jane's look and expression filled him with
awe, and made him anxious and uneasy. He heard
Anson in the next room, where she usually sat with a
door between the rooms a little open. He said :


\"I dare say Anson will be so good as to sew a button
on my glove ?"  
  
  
  Yes," said Aunt Jane. " Ask her."


He went into the next room, said out loud, " Will you
be so good as to sew a button on my glove, Mrs. Anson ?"
while he wrote rapidly on a piece of letter: " You had
better telegraph to the Selwynsons."


Looking at him, Anson perhaps read in his face a
confirmation of her own fears.


\"Yes, sir," she whispered. " I think it will be best.
I will ask Thomson to see to it. Very soon Dr. Spencer
will be here. It is time for him to come."


\"Have you got sewing-silk ? Some one said buttons
—buttons to be sewed on," Aunt Jane said as Walter
returned to her. " I remember it was you. I cannot
talk much. Wdl you read ? The mark is in the place."


He read for half an hour, when, seeing she was asleep,
lie desisted. Another half-hour passed, and Kate crept
noiselessly into the room, and obeyed Walter's signal
to remain. Some twenty minutes afterwards Aunt Jane
opened her eyes and said something incoherently. Anson
hearing her voice, came to her and offered medicine,
holding it in a spoon to the lips of the invalid. She
pushed it away, and shook her head. Some chaDge was
creeping over her countenance.


Dr. Spencer came in at that moment. He looked very
grave when he saw her, asked for brandy, moistened her
14—2
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 212 -->
lips, felt her pulse; then, standing aside, whispered to
Walter:  
  
  
  " I can do nothing—this is death!"


"Give me your hands, children," she murmured.
Kate and Walter laid their hands in hers. " You have
been good to me," she said. " Take care* of each
■other."  
  
  
  Perhaps she thought they were Ada and John.


Ten minutes later Walter led Kate away from the
chamber of the dead. He took her to an arbour in the
garden. Her pallid, awe-struck face alarmed him, and
he judged the fresh air would restore her soonest. He
stood by her till the death-like white look had departed
and she began to cry quietly. He then left her,
returning after a whde and finding her calmer, he said,
standing straight before her:


\"Kate, forgive me. Dearest, dearest, for the sake of
her that is gone, trust me again."


After a momentary pause, Kate raised her eyes. Her
lips moved without sound. He stooped and kissed her.


There was subdued happiness and peace in the house
of the restful dead. She who was gone had woven the
happiness of others with her latest breath; she had
passed from earth leaving blessing and peace with some
she loved.

NOTICE : A Kew Novel by the Author of " A Canadian Heroine,"
\"Against Her Will," &c.

GfrafADY'S HOLM. By Annie L. Walker, author
jJH of "Against Her Will," "A Canadian Heroine," &c.
■ ' 3 vols. 3is. 6d.
' The Academy (August 31st) says:—"As a piece of genuine, careful,
and successful work. ' Lady's Holm ' will bear a very favourable comparison
with most of the new novels of the season - The life led by Mary
Langford and her uncle Stephen at Lady's Holm is very sweeL and beautiful,
and the conception of a daintily pure and highly refined mind 'Lady's
Holm ' is certain to become popular with a large circle of readers who are
weary and disgusted with much in modern fiction."

The Spectator (Sept. 7th) says : Miss Walker's novel will be found well
worth reading by all who can enjoy picturesque description and good
incisive delineation of character."

John Bull (Sept. 14th) says : " It is a long while since we have read a
prettier story than ' Lady's Holm.' It has a charm of its own, which
pervades it from the first page to the last, and makes it quite a matter of regret
when that last page is reached We cordially recommend the book,
which will be found thoroughly readable."

The Scotsman says : "A novel of more than average merit."
FROZEN HEARTS. By G. Webb Appleton.  
  
  
  3 vols., 31s. 6d.


The Academy (August 31st) says :—" We confess to having read ' Frozen
Hearts'with interest. It is full of all kinds of excitement, and in some
places reveals evidence of strong dramatic power."

The Court Circular says:—" An indubitably vigorous and interesting
novel.. It certainly deserves a warm reception. ' Frozen Hearts' is a
very clever book."

The Scotsman says :—"There is so much power and pathos in the
narrative as to give it an impress of realism. The story is a wholesome one
too The local colouring is fairly correct, and the novel is, on the
whole, one that most people can read with hearty relish."

31s. 6d.
ELIOT THE YOUNGER : a Fiction inFree
hand. By Bernard Barker. 3 vols. 31s. 6d.

The Athenæum says:—"Mr. Barker's story has several merits'. The
relations between Phœbe Langham and the young Oxonian are eminently
natural. The Skimpole-like Draycott and the cynical Ogilvie, Oscar
Dale and Margaret, all are substantial entities."

The Sunday Times says:—"Decidedly a wholesome, stirring novel.
{empty}. The hero of the story takes our fancy from the first, and never ceases
to interest till the last page of the book."

Financial Opinion says :—" These three volumes contain more wit, and
wisdom, and poetry, and epigram than would set up a score of average
novelists... A book which Peacock might have written, and which
Charles Lamb would have chuckled over."

The Graphic says :—"This book impresses us as the work of a shrewd,
thoughtful, and well-read man, with a good deal of genuine humour."

The Saturday Review says : " Mr. Barker tells his story with such
immense vivacity that it may be read with comparative ease."
MAID ELLICE. By the Author of " Pretty Miss

Bellew," " True to Her Trust," &c. 3 vols. 31s. 6d.

The Sunday Times says:—"An original and clever story. We
can heartily recommend 'Maid Ellice ' to our readers."

The Scotsman says :—" Vigour in the conception and dramatic force in
the working out of distinctive studies of character are the especial qualities
of this novel. The plot, though exceedingly complicated, is skilfully
managed, and the book altogether possesses an individuality and an
otiginality, both in subject and treatment, which are as welcome as they are raie."

The Standard says :—" ' Ellice ' is a boo^ well worth reading."
SECOND EDITION OF THE LITTLE LOO:


a Tale of the South Sea. By Sydney Mostyn, author of

\"The Surgeon's Secret," &c. 3 vols., 31s. 6d.

The Spectator says :—" We have nothing but praise to give to the stciy.
It is well conceived and powerfully told. Every detail is careiully contrived
to give effect to the whole."

The Scotsman says :- " Mr. Mostyn's story is full of thrilling interest
from the first pare to the last. It is capitally written."

The Sunday Times says :—"It is difficult in few words to convey the
charm that this book possesses; from first to last the interest never flrgs."

Financial Opinion says:—"Not Marryatt, or Dana, or Hciman
Melville himself has written any better sea stories than this tale of the ' Little
Loo.' "

Augustus Mongredien. 3 vols. 31s. 6d.

Each Complete in One Volume.—Ready.
IN THE SPRING OF MY LIFE : a Love Story.

By the Princess Olga Cantacuzene. (From the French.)

Crown 8vo., 7s. 6d.

"A charming little romance. It is treated so delicately and simply,
and is so free from vulgarity and bold commonplace, that it interests the
reader from beginning to end."—Athenæum.

"A very pretty story.,. Agnes is a very finely-drawn character."—
Spectator.

\"Is charmingly told, and proves very pleasant reading. Superior to
average works of its class."—Sunday Times.

\"A very pretty story. The book is thoroughly interesting, and there
is not a dull page from beginning to end. The last chapters are very
touching, and the conclusion reminds us strongly of Villette. We hope
the book will find many readers."—John Bull.

' In the Spring of My Life' can be safely recommended to our readers,
who, if they accept our recommendation, will be amply repaid by the
perusal of a sparkling narrative."—Public Opinion.

"A very pretty love story, and we know of no work of fiction that is so
thoroughly pure and worthy of commendation. It is a clever novel, well
worth reading. The translation is excellent."—Preston Herald.
',_" One of the most pleasing tales which the present season has produced
{empty}. We ought to add that the work has been so admirably translated that
it would be impossible for even an acute critic to detect its foreign origin."
—Bristol Mercury.

THE GREGORS: a Cornish Story. By Jane H.

Spettigue. Crown 8vo., 7s. 6d.
{empty}. "The story is emphaticallyoriginal and genuinelyjinteresting."—Scotsman,

"A really interesting and attractive story."—John Bull (Sept. 7th).

\"We do not remember to have seen Miss Spettigue's name before. Her
book has in any case much merit. It" it is a first effort, it shows no common
promise. It is a well and vigorously drawn picture of life among a people
whose peculiarities had not been smoothed away by civilization. Not a
few touches remind us of the pen of George Eliot, the master of whom all
writers of this kind of fiction may be content to be considered disciples
We Can recommend ' The Gregors' as a well-written and interesting tale."
—Spectator {Sept. 14th).

"The story is told with considerable force and spirit, and its rough and
homely dramatis personœ are decidedly lifelike figures Altogether it
is a very creditable performance."—Graphic (Sept. 14th).

IN TROPIC SEAS : a Tale of the Spanish Main.

By W. Westall. Crown 8vo., ys. 6d.

Tale. By H. S. Tagson. (The Author's Translation.)

Crown 8vo., 7s. 6d.

\"The historical interest of the book is quite as great as its fictional
attraction; nevertheless it is even as a novel eminently readable."—Scotsman.

\"Not only interesting as a story, but somewhat instructive and valuable
as an historical narrative. It relates some of the principal incidents in the
life of Chritian II. of Denmark Con-tains some fine elements for a
tragedy It has not suffered in Henry Tagson's hands The author
gives us a very pretty and swee'. picture of Dyveke, and there is little or no
suggestion of evil in the story."—Academy.

8vo., price 7s. 6d.

\"It is pleasantly written, and in some parts the book is most amusing.
The two old maids, Miss Hunt and Miss Robinson, are capitally drawn,
indeed most of the characters are cleverly sketched... If Miss Ashtort
intends to give us a further instalment we shall look forward to it with
interest, and hope it may be as successful as the present charming little tale."
—John Bull.

Academy.

surrender themselves to its melo-dramatic enjoyment. From title-page to

  BOOKS OF TRAVEL, &c.

IlfWO YEARS OF THE EASTERN
QUESgjJI TION. By A. Gallenga (of the Times), author of
"Italy Revisited," " Country Life in Piedmont/' "The

Invasion of Denmark," etc. 2 vols., Svo., price 30s.

The Times says :—"A more thorough exposure of the rottenness of the
Turkish System was never penned; and Mr. Freeman and Mr. Gladstone
must rejoice when they peruse page after page which, to use a familiar
expression, does not leave on the Turks ' the face of a dog.' But Mr.

Gallenga did not visit Constantinople to quarrel, but to observe the various
phases of the Eastern Question as it passed from diplomatic remonstrances
to provincial outbreaks, to Bulgarian atrocities, to the Servian war, to the
Armistice, to the Conference, to renewed Protocols, and at last to this war
between Russia and Turkey Extraordinary opportunities fell into

Mr. Gallenga's way, and in these very interesting volumes he has availed
himself of them to the full."


The Observer says :—" The great merit of these two interesting volumes
is that they present the grave considered judgment of an intelligent,
thoughtful observer on the internal condition of Turkey. For anyone who Would
really know the social forces now at work within the Turkish Empire, and
who would aspire to make any intelligent forecast as to its future fate,
these volumes are invaluable guides. The book is at once fascinating
and amusing, and in many ways the best recent contribution to the literature
of the Eastern Question."

The Saturday Review says :—" Mr. Gallenga's reminiscences of the East
are both agreeable and instructive. Notwithstanding his long practice as
an English writer, it is surprising that a foreigner should have acquired the
command of style and literary skill which are displayed in his present work
as in many former publications."

The Graphic says :—" Mr. Gallenga's letters are most interesting in
every way—bright with the genuine freshness of a correspondent who finds
himself on (to him) new ground, and enjoys as much as any of his readers a
moonlight ride round Stamboul, v visit to the fields of Troy, a sight of the
Sultan opening his Parliament; valuable for descriptions, by a trained
observer, of scenes and Institutions which fell beneath his eye, and
speculations, by a well informed politician, on the scruples and suspicions which
have ended in keeping Europe impotent while Russia and Turkey are
closing hand to hand Two volumes, altogether, which bid fair to

acquire permanent value as graphic records taken on the spot of some of
the most dramatic incidents in history."

The Academy says :—" Mr. Gallenga has given a detailed account of the
circumstances which led to the present war, beginning from the
commenceof the insurrection in the Herzegovina. As he resided in Constantinople
during the whole of this period, and had special facilities for obtaining
information as the correspondent of the Times newspaper, his narrative is of
great value. He went there with an unprejudiced mind, having, in fact,
given but little attention to 'he subject until that time. Mr. Gallenga also
initiates us into most of the questions relating to Turkey, on which the
reader desires an unbiassed opinion —the good and bad of the character of
the Turks themselves, their finances, their reforms, their relation to the
subject races, and the principal influences that are at work among them.
But the interest of his narrative culminates in that group of events which are
exciting enough for any wotk of fiction."

ITALY REVISITED. By A. Gallenga. Author

of " Italy, Past and Present," " Country Life in Piedmont,"

etc. 2 vols., demy 8vo., 30s. Second Edition.

Times, Nov. 11, 1875.—" Mr. Gallenga's new volumes on Italy will be
welcome to those who care for an unprejudiced account of the prospects and
present condition of the country.In noticing Mr. Gallenga's most
interesting volumes, we have been obliged to confine ourselves chiefly to
topics of grave and national importance, and we wish we could also have
done justice to his impressions of the Italy he revisited as seen in its lighter
and social aspects."

Spectator, Nov. 20, 1875. — "The two volumes abound in interesting
matter, with vivid sketches of places and persons,—Florence for instance,—
Garibaldi and Mazzini. The personal reminiscences, too, of the author's
bloodless campaign with Prince Napoleon in 1859 are notably interesting."

Observer, Nov. 7, 1875.—" Facileprinceps in the ranks of those who
have laboured, through the influential channel of journalism, to arouse the
sympathies of the world for the kingdom of Italy, and to enable it to judge
of Italy's condition and Italy's prospects, has been, and still is, Mr. Gallenga.
It would be wonderful it' any one could pretend to be his rival."

Athenæum, Nov. 20, 1875.—" Mr. Gallenga's two volumes are as
distinctly superior to the usual newspaper correspondent's platitudes, as they
are free from the egotistical garrulities with which tourists, and especially
tourists in Italy, have made us familiar."

Daily News, Dec. 3, 1875.—"Is beyond comparison the most readable,
and at the same time, the most trustworthy account of the actual condition
and prospects of a nation and kingdom which but yesterday were a dream
of visionaries, and to-day are among the most potent and practical realities
of the modern world. The lightest or the most serious reader may find
plenty of attractive matter in these varied and suggestive pages, from the
liveliest stories to the weightiest economic considerations and statistics."

World, Dec. 1, 1875.—" Were there to be a judgment of Paris among
the rivalries of modern journalists, the three competitors would, we suppose,
have to be Mr. Gallenga, Mr. Sala, and Mr. Russell, and we should award
the apple without hesitation to Mr. Gallenga. He is the best informed, the
most accurate, the most highly educated, the best linguist, the most variously
experienced of the three His is by far the most classic pen, and the
best measured style. He has just published a couple of entertaining and
instructive volumes."

UNTRODDEN SPAIN, and her Black Country.

Being Sketches of the Life and Character of the Spaniard of

the Interior. By Hugh James Rose, M.A., of Oriel College,

Oxford. In 2 vols., 8vo., price 30s. (Second Edition.)

The Times says—" These volumes form a very pleasing commentary on
aland and a people to which Englishmen will always turn with sympathetic
interest."

The Saturday Bevie-w says—" His title of' Untrodden Spain' is no
misnomer. He leads us into scenes and among classes of Spaniards where few
English writers have preceded him We can only recommend our
readers to get it and search for themselves. Those who are most intimately
acquainted with Spain will best appreciate its varied excellence."

The Spectator says—"The author's kindliness is as conspicuous as his
closeness of observation and fairness of judgment; his sympathy with the
people inspires his pen as happily as does his anistic appreciation of the
country; and both have combined in the production of a work of striking
novelty and sterling value."  
  
  
  Samuel Tinsley & Co., 10, Southampton St., Strand.
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 26 -->

The Standard says—" It is fresh, life-like, and chatty, and is written by
a man who is accustomed to look below the surface of things."


The Athenæum says—" We regret that we cannot make further extracts,
for ' Untrodden Spain ' is by far the best book upon Spanish peasant life
that we have ever met with."


The Literary Churchman says—"Seldom has a book of travel come
before us which has so taken our fancy in reading, and left behind it, when
the reading was over, so distinct an impression. We must reluctantly
close our review of these delightful volumes, leaving the major part of them
unnoticed. But we have quoted sufficient to show our readers how well the
author has used his opportunities."


The Nonconformist says—"This book forms most interesting reading.
It is the result of careful observation, it communicates many facts, it is
written in a polished yet lively style, and will thus, perhaps, remain for
some time the best reference-book about rural Spain."


The Field says—"An amount of really valuable information respecting
the lower classes of Spaniards, their daily life and conversation, and ways of
looking at things, such as few writers have given us."


The John Bull says—" We have rarely been able to recommend a book
more cordially. It has not a dull page Deserves to be a great
success."

TRAVELS WEST. By William Minturn. Large

post Svo., price 7s. 6d.


The Dally News says—"An unpretending volume of travel, the author
of which describes in a lively vein what he saw and heard in a recent
journey from New York to St. Louis, thence to Salt Lake City and
California, and back by Omaha and Chicago into Canada."  
  
  
  Samuel Tinsley & Co., 10, Southampton St., Strand.
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 27 -->

Public Opinion says—"A charming book, full of anecdotes of Western
American travel, and in which, the author, who travelled from New York
across the whole American Western desert, gives his experience of a country
almost unknown to European colonists. We wish we could transcribe
some of the very clear descriptions of scenery, life, and manners in which
this book abounds."

The Queen says—" Mr. Minturn writes easily and pleasantly, and gives
us vivid pictures of the marvellous scenery The whole tone of Mr.
Minturn's book is pleasant to the English reader. in a word, good sense
and culture contribute to make the volume well worth the attention of those
who are interested in travel on the American Continent."


Vanity Fair says—" Some of our ablest authors have failed in the
endeavour to depict American life and society. The author of the present work,
however, is an American by birth who has spent most of his life in Europe,
and he describes his return to America and his tour through the States in a
very interesting volume Altogether the work is well-written and
interesting."

The Literary World says—'' A trip across America is a grand thing for
the tourist, English or American, in the course of his career. Anyone
contemplating such a journey should have a look at Mr. Minturn's book."
